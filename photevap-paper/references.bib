  shorttitle = {Follow-up Imaging of Disk Candidates from the Disk Detective Citizen Science Project},
  abstract = {The Disk Detective citizen science project aims to find new stars with excess 22-$\mu$m emission from circumstellar dust in the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We evaluated 261 Disk Detective objects of interest with imaging with the Robo-AO adaptive optics instrument on the 1.5m telescope at Palomar Observatory and with RetroCam on the 2.5m du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to search for background objects at 0.15''-12'' separations from each target. Our analysis of these data lead us to reject 7% of targets. Combining this result with statistics from our online image classification efforts implies that at most $7.9\% \pm 0.2\%$ of AllWISE-selected infrared excesses are good disk candidates. Applying our false positive rates to other surveys, we find that the infrared excess searches of McDonald et al. (2012), McDonald et al. (2017), and Marton et al. (2016) all have false positive rates $>70\%$. Moreover, we find that all thirteen disk candidates in Theissen & West (2014) with W4 signal-to-noise >3 are false positives. We present 244 disk candidates that have survived vetting by follow-up imaging. Of these, 213 are newly-identified disk systems. Twelve of these are candidate members of comoving pairs based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, supporting the hypothesis that warm dust is associated with binary systems. We also note the discovery of 22 $\mu$m excess around two known members of the Scorpius-Centaurus association, and identify known disk host WISEA J164540.79-310226.6 as a likely Sco-Cen member. Thirty-one of these disk candidates are closer than $\sim 125$ pc (including 27 debris disks), making them good targets for direct imaging exoplanet searches.},

  doi = {10.1086/345807},
  abstract = {Far-ultraviolet (FUV, 6 eV < h  < 13:6 eV) radiation has been suggested as the main source of heating of the neutral interstellar gas, and, in this case, it determines whether the thermal balance of the neutral gas results in cold (T $ 50 100 K) clouds (cold neutral material [CNM]), warm (T $ 104 K) clouds (warm neutral material [WNM]), or a combination of the two. For gas at ﬁxed mean density, high FUV ﬁelds convert the neutral gas to WNM, while low ﬁelds result in CNM. The main sources of interstellar FUV radiation are short-lived massive stars in associations that form in giant molecular clouds. Using McKee & Williams’ distribution of birthrates for OB associations in the Galaxy, we determine the expected behavior of the timedependent FUV ﬁeld for random positions in the ISM at the solar circle. The FUV ﬁeld is calculated in two bands (912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ ) and at the wavelength 1400 A˚ . In terms of UÀ17   U= ð10À17 ergs cmÀ3 GÀ1Þ, where U is the energy density of the radiation ﬁeld in some band, we ﬁnd (mean, median) values at the solar circle of UÀ17 ¼ ð15:7; 7:4Þ and (14.2, 7.2) for the 912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ bands, respectively. At 1400 A˚ we ﬁnd (mean, median) values of UÀ17 ¼ ð14:4; 7:5Þ. Our median value for the 912–2070 A˚ band is G0 ¼ 1:6 times Habing’s value for the radiation ﬁeld at the solar circle in this band and quite close to Draine’s value, G0 ¼ 1:7. Habing and Draine’s values are based on observations of sources of FUV radiation in the solar neighborhood, so all three values are close to observed values. Because of attenuation by dust, only associations within about 500 pc contribute signiﬁcantly to the energy density at a given point. Large-angle scattering produces a diﬀuse ﬁeld that is about 10% of the ﬁeld produced by the sum of direct and small-angle (<5 ) scattering from discrete sources (the associations), as observed. At a point exposed to the median radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association typically produces about 20% of the total energy density. At a point exposed to an above average radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association produces most of the energy density. Therefore, the FUV ﬁeld is asymmetric at a given point, and the asymmetry grows for higher ﬁelds. The FUV ﬁeld ﬂuctuates with a variety of amplitudes, the larger ones being less frequent. The mean ﬁeld is about twice the median ﬁeld because of these ﬂuctuations, or spikes, in the radiation ﬁeld. These spikes, which last $30 Myr, are caused by the infrequent birth of nearby associations. For spikes that are signiﬁcantly higher than the mean ﬁeld, the time interval between spikes is $2UÀ3=125 Gyr. We also model shorter duration spikes caused by runaway OB stars. The presence of a ﬂuctuating heating rate created by the ﬂuctuating FUV ﬁeld converts CNM to WNM and vice versa.},

  abstract = {We present an extended ultraviolet-blue (850–4700 8) library of theoretical stellar spectral energy distributions computed at high resolution, k/Ák ¼ 50;000. The UVBLUE grid, as we named the library, is based on LTE calculations carried out with ATLAS9 and SYNTHE codes developed by R. L. Kurucz and consists of nearly 1800 entries that cover a large volume of the parameter space. It spans a range in TeA from 3000 to 50,000 K, the surface gravity ranges from log g ¼ 0:0 to 5.0 with Álog g ¼ 0:5 dex, while seven chemical compositions are considered: ½M/H ¼ À2:0; À1:5; À1:0; À0:5; þ0:0; þ0:3, and +0.5 dex. For its coverage across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, this library is the most comprehensive one ever computed at high resolution in the short-wavelength spectral range, and useful application can be foreseen for both the study of single stars and in population synthesis models of galaxies and other stellar systems. We brieﬂy discuss some relevant issues for a safe application of the theoretical output to ultraviolet observations, and a comparison of our LTE models with the non-LTE (NLTE) ones from the TLUSTY code is also carried out. NLTE spectra are found, on average, to be slightly ‘‘redder’’ compared to the LTE ones for the same value of TeA, while a larger difference could be detected for weak lines, which are nearly wiped out by the enhanced core emission component in case of NLTE atmospheres. These effects seem to be magniﬁed at low metallicity (typically [M/H] PÀ1). A match with a working sample of 111 stars from the IUE atlas, with available atmosphere parameters from the literature, shows that UVBLUE models provide an accurate description of the main mid- and low-resolution spectral features for stars along the whole sequence from the B to $G5 type. The comparison sensibly degrades for later spectral types, with supergiant stars that are in general more poorly reproduced than dwarfs. As a possible explanation of this overall trend, we partly invoke the uncertainty in the input atmosphere parameters to compute the theoretical spectra. In addition, one should also consider the important contamination of the IUE stellar sample, where the presence of binary and variable stars certainly works in the sense of artiﬁcially worsening the match between theory and observations.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Ophiuchus DIsc Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA), a project aiming to study the entire population of Spitzer-selected protoplanetary discs in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud (~300 objects) from both millimeter continuum and CO isotopologues data. Here we present 1.3 mm/230 GHz continuum images of 147 targets at 0.2" (28 au) resolution and a typical rms of 0.15 mJy. We detect a total of 133 discs, including the individual components of 11 binary systems and 1 triple system. Fifty-three of these discs are spatially resolved. We find clear substructures (inner cavities, rings, gaps, and/or spiral arms) in 8 of the sources and hints of such structures in another 4 discs. We construct the disc luminosity function for our targets and perform comparisons to other regions. A simple conversion between flux and dust mass (adopting standard assumptions) indicates that all discs detected at 1.3 mm are massive enough to form one or more rocky planets. In contrast, only ~50 discs (~1/3 of the sample) have enough mass in the form of dust to form the canonical 10 M_Earth core needed to trigger runaway gas accretion and the formation of gas giant planets, although the total mass of solids already incorporated into bodies larger than cm scales is mostly unconstrained. The distribution in continuum disc sizes in our sample is heavily weighted towards compact discs: most detected discs have radii < 15 au, while only 23 discs (~15% of the targets) have radii > 30 au.},

  abstract = {We present high resolution millimeter continuum imaging of the disc surrounding the young star CI Tau, a system hosting the first hot Jupiter candidate in a protoplanetary disc system. The system has extended mm emission on which are superposed three prominent annular gaps at radii ~ 13, 39 and 100 au. We argue that these gaps are most likely to be generated by massive planets so that, including the hot Jupiter, the system contains four gas giant planets at an age of only 2 Myr. Two of the new planets are similarly located to those inferred in the famous HL Tau protoplanetary disc; in CI Tau, additional observational data enables a more complete analysis of the system properties than was possible for HL Tau. Our dust and gas dynamical modeling satisfies every available observational constraint and points to the most massive ensemble of exo-planets ever detected at this age, with its four planets spanning a factor 1000 in orbital radius.Our results show that the association between hot Jupiters and gas giants on wider orbits, observed in older stars, is apparently in place at an early evolutionary stage.},

  doi = {10.1093/mnras/sty2323},
  abstract = {We present an open access grid of 3930 calculations of externally evaporating protoplanetary discs. This spans a range of disc sizes (1-400 au), disc masses, UV field strengths (10-10<SUP>4</SUP> G<SUB>0</SUB>), and stellar masses (0.05-1.9 M<SUB>☉</SUB>). The grid is publicly available for download, and offers a means of cheaply including external photoevaporation in disc evolutionary calculations. It can also be queried using an online tool for quick estimates of instantaneous mass-loss rates (e.g for convenient evaluation of real observed systems). The ``FRIED'' grid itself illustrates that for discs around stars ≤0.3 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, external photoevaporation is effective down to small radii (&lt;50 au) down to UV fields at least as weak as 10 G<SUB>0</SUB>. At the other end of the scale, in a 10<SUP>4</SUP> G<SUB>0</SUB> environment photoevaporation is effective down to 1 au even for stellar masses at least as high as 1.9 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. We also illustrate in which regimes CO survives in the photoevaporative outflow for significant mass-loss rates; marking a system a good candidate to detect external photoevaporation in weak-intermediate UV environments through sub-Keplerian rotation. Finally, we make illustrative mass-loss rate estimates for discs in Taurus based on the Guilloteau et al. (2011) star-disc parameters, finding that around half are expected to have both significant mass-loss and retain CO in the photoevaporative outflow.},

In this paper, we perform the first full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the flow from the outer rim of protoplanetary discs externally irradiated by such intermediate strength FUV fields, including direct modelling of the photon-dominated region which is required to accurately compute the thermal properties. We find excellent agreement between our models and the semi-analytic models of Facchini et al. (2016) for the profile of the flow itself, as well as the mass-loss rate and location of their `critical radius'. This both validates their results (which differed significantly from prior semi-analytic estimates) and our new numerical method, the latter of which can now be applied to elements of the problem that the semi-analytic approaches are incapable of modelling. We also obtain the composition of the flow, but given the simple geometry of our models we can only hint at some diagnostics for future observations of externally irradiated discs at this stage. We also discuss the potential for these models as benchmarks for future photochemical-dynamical codes.},

  doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/774/1/9},
  abstract = {This paper explores the effects of FUV radiation fields from external stars on circumstellar disk evolution. Disks residing in young clusters can be exposed to extreme levels of FUV flux from nearby OB stars, and observations show that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated. Typical FUV flux levels can be factors of ~10<SUP>2</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> higher than the interstellar value. These fields are effective in driving mass loss from circumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the host star, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitational potential well is shallow. We combine viscous evolution (an α-disk model) with an existing FUV photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disk lifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, including mass-loss rates, disk masses, and radii. We also consider the effects of X-ray photoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that for disks around solar-mass stars, externally generated FUV fields are often the dominant mechanism in depleting disk material. For sufficiently large viscosities, FUV fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entire range of parameter space. Disks with viscosity parameter α = 10<SUP>-3</SUP> are effectively dispersed within 1-3 Myr for higher viscosities (α = 10<SUP>-2</SUP>) disks are dispersed within ~0.25-0.5 Myr. Furthermore, disk radii are truncated to less than ~100 AU, which can possibly affect the formation of planets. Our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed masses and radii of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster.},

  doi = {10.1093/mnras/sty168},
  abstract = {We study the evolution of protoplanetary discs that would have been precursors of a Trappist-1-like system under the action of accretion and external photoevaporation in different radiation environments. Dust grains swiftly grow above the critical size below which they are entrained in the photoevaporative wind, so although gas is continually depleted, dust is resilient to photoevaporation after only a short time. This means that the ratio of the mass in solids (dust plus planetary) to the mass in gas rises steadily over time. Dust is still stripped early on, and the initial disc mass required to produce the observed 4 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> of Trappist-1 planets is high. For example, assuming a Fatuzzo &amp; Adams distribution of UV fields, typical initial disc masses have to be &gt;30 per cent the stellar (which are still Toomre Q stable) for the majority of similar mass M dwarfs to be viable hosts of the Trappist-1 planets. Even in the case of the lowest UV environments observed, there is a strong loss of dust due to photoevaporation at early times from the weakly bound outer regions of the disc. This minimum level of dust loss is a factor of 2 higher than that which would be lost by accretion on to the star during 10 Myr of evolution. Consequently, even in these least irradiated environments, discs that are viable Trappist-1 precursors need to be initially massive (&gt;10 per cent of the stellar mass).},

  abstract = {We present models in which the photoevaporation of discs around young stars by an external ultraviolet source (as computed by Adams et al.) is coupled with the internal viscous evolution of the discs. These models are applied to the case of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), where the presence of a strong ultraviolet field from the central OB stars, together with a detailed census of circumstellar discs and photoevaporative flows, is well established. In particular we investigate the constraints that are placed on the initial disc properties in the ONC by the twin requirement that most stars possess a disc on a scale of a few astronomical unit (au), but that only a minority (&lt;20 per cent) are resolved by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at a scale of 50au. We find that these requirements place very weak constraints on the initial radius distribution of circumstellar discs: the resulting size distribution readily forgets the initial radius distribution, owing to the strong positive dependence of the photoevaporation rate on disc radius. Instead, the scarcity of large discs reflects the relative scarcity of initially massive discs (with mass &gt;0.1M<SUB>solar</SUB>). The ubiquity of discs on a small scale, on the other hand, mainly constrains the time-span over which the discs have been exposed to the ultraviolet field (&lt;2Myr). We argue that the discs that are resolved by HST represent a population of discs in which self-gravity was important at the time that the dominant central OB star switched on, but that, according to our models, self-gravity is unlikely to be important in these discs at the present time. We discuss the implications of our results for the so-called proplyd lifetime problem.},

  title = {Why do protoplanetary disks appear not massive enough to form the known exoplanet population?},
  abstract = {When and how planets form in protoplanetary disks is still a topic of discussion. Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now providing results that allow us to have new insights. We collect the masses of confirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence with stellar mass with the same dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in ~1-3 Myr old star-forming regions. The latter are recalculated by us using the new estimates of their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and multiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing to a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low mass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower than the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses are comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found also by converting the measured planet masses into heavy-element content (core masses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and by comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are heavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient recycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This implies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly (<0.1-1 Myr) and large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or that disks are continuously replenished of fresh planet-forming material from the environment. These hypotheses can be tested by measuring disk masses in even younger targets and by better understanding if and how the disks are replenished by their surroundings.},

  abstract = {Lifetimes of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are believed to be severely constrained by material depleting mechanisms, including photoevaporative winds due to the host star radiation or external radiation sources. Most previous studies focused on exploring the role of the winds in the exposed PPDs with a single star; however, exploring the evolution of the circumbinary disks with the photoevaporative winds driven by the host star radiation and external radiation sources deserves further investigation. In this study, we investigate the evolution of the circumbinary PPDs with the photoevaporative winds induced by external far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field. We show that this mass-loss process can significantly constrain properties of a circumbinary PPD, including its lifetime, mass and radius. The lifetime of a circumbinary PPD, for instance, is found by a factor of about two longer than a similar circumstellar disk and this enhancement strongly depends on the viscosity parameter. But our model shows that viscosity dependence of the disk lifetime in the circumbinary case is more pronounced compared to the circumstellar case. We also show that dispersal of a circumbinary PPD occurs over a longer time as the disk temperature distribution becomes steeper. Our results also imply that dead zone in a photoevaporative circumbinary PPD extends over a larger radial range in comparison to a circumstellar disk counterpart. We also show that our calculations are in agreement with the observed circumbinary PPDs orbiting equal-mass binaries.},

However, the high resolution images have also shown that the optically thin assumption for millimeter continuum emission may not be valid and the low values of the spectral index may be related to optical depth rather than dust growth. Longer wavelength observations are essential to properly disentangle these effects. The high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will open up the possibilities to spatially resolve disk continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths and beyond, which allows the study of dust growth in disks in the optically thin regime and further constrain models of planet formation.},

Observationally, Massey ﬁnds such a deﬁcit in samples of the ﬁeld population in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, with an initial mass function (IMF) slope of ΓIMF ∼ 4. These IMF measurements represent some of the largest known deviations from the standard Salpeter IMF slope of ΓIMF = 1.35. Here, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the mass function above 20 M for the entire ﬁeld population of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on data from the Runaways and Isolated O Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4). This is a spatially complete census of the entire ﬁeld OB star population of the SMC obtained with the IMACS multi-object spectrograph and MIKE echelle spectrograph on the Magellan telescopes. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of the evolved present-day mass function, we ﬁnd the slope of the ﬁeld IMF above 20 M is ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.4. We extend our IMF measurement to lower masses using BV photometry from the OGLE II survey. We use a statistical approach to generate a probability distribution for the mass of each star from the OGLE photometry, and we again ﬁnd ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.6 for stellar masses from 7 M to 20 M . The discovery and removal of ten runaways in our RIOTS4 sample steepens the ﬁeld IMF slope to ΓIMF = 2.8 ± 0.5. We discuss the possible effects of binarity and star formation history on our results, and conclude that the steep ﬁeld massive star IMF is most likely a real effect.},

  doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/804/1/29},
  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are dispersed by viscous evolution and photoevaporation in a few million years; in the interim small, sub-micron-sized dust grains must grow and form planets. The time-varying abundance of small grains in an evolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons, while dust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and resulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in turn, selectively carry small dust grains, leaving the larger particles—which decouple, from the gas—behind in the disk. We study these effects by investigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by EUV, FUV, and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a one-dimensional (1D) multi-fluid approach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface density distributions. The 1D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models constructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and determine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust coagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk lifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is thus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find that photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass ratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result in a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen. We discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet formation, including the formation of gas-poor giants. After gas disk dispersal, ̃ 3× {{10}<SUP>-4</SUP>} M <SUB>☉ </SUB> of mass in solids typically remain, comparable to the solids inventory of our solar system.},

Viscous accretion depletes significant amounts of the mass in gas and solids, while photoevaporative flows driven by internal and external irradiation remove most of the gas. A reasonably large fraction of the mass in solids and some gas get incorporated into planets.

  title = {Photoevaporation of Circumstellar Disks Due to External Far-Ultraviolet Radiation in Stellar Aggregates},
  volume = {611},
  doi = {10.1086/421989},
  abstract = {When stars form within small groups (with N<SUB>*</SUB>~100-500 members), their circumstellar disks are exposed to relatively little extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; hν&gt;13.6 eV) radiation but a great deal of far-ultraviolet (FUV; 6eV&lt;hν&lt;13.6eV) radiation (~10<SUP>3</SUP> times the local interstellar FUV field) from the most massive stars in the group. This paper calculates the mass-loss rates and evaporation timescales for circumstellar disks exposed to external FUV radiation. Previous work treated large disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius r<SUB>d</SUB> exceeds the critical radius r<SUB>g</SUB> where the sound speed in the FUV heated surface layer exceeds the escape speed; it has often been assumed that photoevaporation occurs for r<SUB>d</SUB>&gt;r<SUB>g</SUB> and is negligible for r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;r<SUB>g</SUB>. Since r<SUB>g</SUB>&gt;~100 AU for FUV heating, this would imply little mass loss from the planet-forming regions of a disk. In this paper we focus on systems in which photoevaporation is suppressed because r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;r<SUB>g</SUB> and show that significant mass loss still takes place as long as r<SUB>d</SUB>/r<SUB>g</SUB>&gt;~0.1-0.2. Some of the gas extends beyond the disk edge (or above the disk surface) to larger distances where the temperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. The resulting evaporation rate is a sensitive function of the central stellar mass and disk radius, which determine the escape speed, and the external FUV flux, which determines the temperature structure of the surface layers and outflowing gas. Disks around red dwarfs, low-mass stars with M<SUB>*</SUB>&lt;~0.5 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, are evaporated and shrink to disk radii r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;~15 AU on short timescales t&lt;~10 Myr when exposed to moderate FUV fields with G<SUB>0</SUB>=3000 (where G<SUB>0</SUB>=1.7 for the local interstellar FUV field). The disks around solar-type stars are more durable. For intense FUV radiation fields with G<SUB>0</SUB>=30,000, however, even these disks shrink to r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;~15 AU on timescales t~10 Myr. Such fields exist within about 0.7 pc of the center of a cluster with N<SUB>*</SUB>~4000 stars. If our solar system formed in the presence of such strong FUV radiation fields, this mechanism could explain why Neptune and Uranus in our solar system are gas-poor, whereas Jupiter and Saturn are relatively gas-rich. This mechanism for photoevaporation can also limit the production of Kuiper Belt objects and can suppress giant planet formation in sufficiently large clusters, such as the Hyades, especially for disks associated with low-mass stars.},

  title = {IN-SYNC. VIII. Primordial Disk Frequencies in NGC 1333, IC 348, and the Orion A Molecular Cloud},
  abstract = {In this paper, we address two issues related to primordial disk evolution in three clusters (NGC 1333, IC 348, and Orion A) observed by the INfrared Spectra of Young Nebulous Clusters (IN-SYNC) project. First, in each cluster, averaged over the spread of age, we investigate how disk lifetime is dependent on stellar mass. The general relation in IC 348 and Orion A is that primordial disks around intermediate mass stars (2--5$M_{\odot}$) evolve faster than those around loss mass stars (0.1--1$M_{\odot}$), which is consistent with previous results. However, considering only low mass stars, we do not find a significant dependence of disk frequency on stellar mass. These results can help to better constrain theories on gas giant planet formation timescales. Secondly, in the Orion A molecular cloud, in the mass range of 0.35--0.7$M_{\odot}$, we provide the most robust evidence to date for disk evolution within a single cluster exhibiting modest age spread. By using surface gravity as an age indicator and employing 4.5 $\mu m$ excess as a primordial disk diagnostic, we observe a trend of decreasing disk frequency for older stars. The detection of intra-cluster disk evolution in NGC 1333 and IC 348 is tentative, since the slight decrease of disk frequency for older stars is a less than 1-$\sigma$ effect.},

  abstract = {We present a methodology to interpret observations of protoplanetary discs where a flyby, also called a tidal encounter, is suspected. In case of a flyby, protoplanetary discs can be significantly disturbed. The resulting dynamical and kinematical signatures can last for several thousands of years after the flyby and hence deeply affect the evolution of the disc. These effects are stronger for closer encounters and more massive perturbers. For the very same flyby parameters, varying the inclination of the perturber's orbit produces a broad range of disc structures: spirals, bridges, warps and cavities. We study this kind of features both in the gas and in the dust for grains ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 10 cm in size. Interestingly, the dust exhibits a different dynamical behaviour compared to the gas because of gas-drag effects. Finally, flybys can also trigger high accretion events in the disc-hosting star, readily similar to FU Orionis-type outbursts. All this information can be used to infer the flyby parameters from an incomplete set of observations at different wavelengths. Therefore, the main scope of our flyby scene investigation (FSI) methodology is to help to interpret recent "puzzling" disc observations.},

It is highly probable that this cluster environment influenced various properties of the solar system such as its chemical composition, size, and the orbital parameters of some of its constituting bodies. <BR /> Aims: In the Milky Way, clusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters and leaky clusters -, each following a unique temporal development in the mass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in the range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster environments as a function of cluster age. Methods.N-body methods were used to investigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions between cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. <BR /> Results: Using the now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age we demonstrate that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first 5 Myr are so high (initially &gt; 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> pc<SUP>-3</SUP>) that hardly any discs with solar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes starburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar system. Instead it is highly probable that the solar system formed in a leaky cluster (often classified as OB association). We demonstrate that an encounter determining the characteristic properties existing in our solar systems most likely happened very early on (&lt;2 Myr) in its formation history and that after 5 Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an encounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the bound remnant. This explains why the solar system could develop and maintain its high circularity later in its development.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are quasi-steady structures whose evolution and dispersal determine the environment for planet formation. I review the theory of protoplanetary disk evolution and its connection to observations. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential angular momentum transport processes—including self-gravity, magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking—and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size, and magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early stages of planet formation and may vary dramatically from star to star. The importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales between 1 AU and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain.},

(2018) suggest that such small dense subpopulations eject all their OB stars via the decay of unstable few-body systems such that the gas can recombine and form new stars. This explains the multisequence phenomenon without introducing an extra mechanism into star formation theory. In this work, we apply the recently updated primordial binary distribution model (Belloni et al. 2017; implemented here in a new version of MCLUSTER) and perform a large set of direct N-body simulations to investigate the feasibility of this dynamical scenario. Our results suggest that if 3-4 OB stars in the ONC formed primordially mass-segregated in the cluster centre with a maximum separation of about 0.003 pc, all OB stars have a high chance (50-70 per cent) to escape from the centre and do not come back within 1 Myr and the dynamical ejection scenario is a viable channel to form short-age-interval multipopulation sequences as observed in the ONC. This is also consistent with self-regulated star formation.},

To illustrate the model, we apply it to the formation of neutron stars, both single and in binaries. The eccentricity of primordial binaries allows a wide, non-interacting binary to survive the first and second supernovae in many more cases than suggested by previous calculations that assume circular orbits. Mass transfer in binaries enhances the rate of type I supernovae with respect to that of the type II supernovae. A sizable fraction of initial binaries merge into a single star; 10-15% of the type II supernovae are from such mergers. Models in which neutron stars receive a kick velocity at birth predict birth rates for wide and close radio-pulsar binaries, and for high-mass (including Be-) X-ray binaries that are roughly in agreement with observations. All our models produce too many Her X-1 type binaries. The formation rate of
radio-pulsars that remain in a binary after the first supernova
explosion and are released at the second supernova event is predicted by our models to be comparable to the formation rate of recycled binary radio pulsars, i.e. less than a few per cent of the formation rate of single radio pulsars.},

We investigate the potential contribution to the SNIa rate from the population of merging double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. We aim to develope a model that fits the observed SNIa progenitors as well as the observed close double white dwarf population. We differentiate between two scenarios for the common envelope (CE) evolution; the alpha-formalism based on the energy equation and the gamma-formalism that is based on the angular momentum equation. In one model we apply the alpha-formalism always. In the second model the gamma-formalism is applied, unless the binary contains a compact object or the CE is triggered by a tidal instability for which the alpha-formalism is used. The binary population synthesis code SeBa was used to evolve binary systems from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of double white dwarfs and subsequent mergers. SeBa has been thoroughly updated since the last publication of the content of the code. The limited sample of observed double white dwarfs is better represented by the simulated population using the gamma-formalism than the alpha-formalism. For both CE formalisms, we find that although the morphology of the simulated delay time distribution matches that of the observations within the errors, the normalisation and time-integrated rate per stellar mass are a factor 7-12 lower than observed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the simulated populations of merging double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are discussed and put in the context of alternative SNIa models for merging double white dwarfs.},

  abstract = {Magnetized winds may be important in dispersing protoplanetary disks and influencing planet formation. We carry out global full magnetohydrodynamic simulations in axisymmetry, coupled with ray-tracing radiative transfer, consistent thermochemistry, and non-ideal MHD diffusivities. Magnetized models lacking EUV photons ($h\nu>13.6\ \mathrm{eV}$) feature warm molecular outflows that have typical poloidal speeds $\gtrsim 4\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$. When the magnetization is sufficient to drive accretion rates $\sim 10^{-8}\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, the wind mass-loss rate is comparable. Such outflows are driven not centrifugally but by the pressure of toroidal magnetic fields produced by bending the poloidal field. Both the accretion and outflow rates increase with the poloidal field energy density, the former almost linearly. The mass-loss rate is also strongly affected by ionization due to UV and X-ray radiation near the wind base. Adding EUV irradiation to the system heats, ionizes, and accelerates the part of the outflow nearest the symmetry axis, but reduces the overall mass-loss rate by exerting pressure on the wind base. Most of our models are non-turbulent, but some with reduced dust abundance and therefore higher ionization fractions exhibit magnetorotational instabilities near the base of the wind.},

However, the first steps of planet formation are likely to occur already when the protostar and disk are still embedded in their natal envelope. The initial conditions for planet formation may thus be provided by these young embedded disks, of which the physical and chemical structure is poorly characterized. <BR /> Aims: We aim to constrain the midplane temperature structure, one of the critical unknowns, of the embedded disk around L1527. In particular, we set out to determine whether there is an extended cold outer region where CO is frozen out, as is the case for Class II disks. This will show whether young disks are indeed warmer than their more evolved counterparts, as is predicted by physical models. <BR /> Methods: We used archival ALMA data of <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 2-1, C<SUP>18</SUP>O J = 2-1 and N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP>J = 3-2 to directly observe the midplane of the near edge-on L1527 disk. The optically thick CO isotopologues allowed us to derive a radial temperature profile for the disk midplane, while N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP>, which can only be abundant when CO is frozen out, provides an additional constraint on the temperature. Moreover, the effect of CO freeze-out on the <SUP>13</SUP>CO, C<SUP>18</SUP>O and N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP> emission was investigated using 3D radiative transfer modeling. <BR /> Results: Optically thick <SUP>13</SUP>CO and C<SUP>18</SUP>O emission is observed throughout the disk and inner envelope, while N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP> is not detected. Both CO isotopologues have brightness temperatures ≳25 K along the midplane. Disk and envelope emission can be disentangled kinematically, because the largest velocities are reached in the disk. A power law radial temperature profile constructed using the highest midplane temperature at these velocities suggest that the temperature is above 20 K out to at least 75 au, and possibly throughout the entire 125 au disk. The radiative transfer models show that a model without CO freeze-out in the disk matches the C<SUP>18</SUP>O observations better than a model with the CO snowline at 70 au. In addition, there is no evidence for a large (order of magnitude) depletion of CO. <BR /> Conclusions: The disk around L1527 is likely to be warm enough to have CO present in the gas phase throughout the disk, suggesting that young embedded disks can indeed be warmer than the more evolved Class II disks.},

While models based on this simplified geometry provide only approximations to the true processes of instability-driven mass and angular momentum transport, their simplicity makes them invaluable tools for both semi-analytic modeling and simulations of long-term evolution where two- or three-dimensional calculations are too computationally costly. Despite the utility of these models, the only publicly-available frameworks for simulating them are rather specialized and non-general. Here we describe a highly flexible, general numerical method for simulating viscous thin disks with arbitrary rotation curves, viscosities, boundary conditions, grid spacings, equations of state, and rates of gain or loss of mass (e.g., through winds) and energy (e.g., through radiation). Our method is based on a conservative, finite-volume, second-order accurate discretization of the equations, which we solve using an unconditionally-stable implicit scheme. We implement Anderson acceleration to speed convergence of the scheme, and show that this leads to factor of ∼5 speed gains over non-accelerated methods in realistic problems, though the amount of speedup is highly problem-dependent. We have implemented our method in the new code Viscous Accretion Disk Evolution Resource (VADER), which is freely available for download from https://bitbucket.org/krumholz/vader/ under the terms of the GNU General Public License.},

  shorttitle = {The ALMA Lupus protoplanetary disk survey},
  abstract = {The cyanide radical CN is abundant in protoplanetary disks, with line fluxes often comparable to those of $^{13}$CO. It is known to be sensitive to UV irradiation of the upper disk atmosphere, with models predicting ring-shaped emission. We seek to characterize the CN emission from 94 Class II disks in the Lupus star forming region, compare it to observations in other regions, and interpret our observations with a grid of models. The CN emission morphology is discussed for two primordial disks, Sz 71 and Sz 98, and modeled in more detail. ALMA observed CN N=3-2 in Lupus disks down to sensitivities better than previous surveys. Models constructed with the physico-chemical code DALI are used to study the integrated fluxes of the disks and resolved emission of CN in disks without (dust) substructures. We find that CN N=3-2 is bright, and detected in 38% of sources, but its disk-integrated flux is not strongly correlated to either $^{13}$CO or continuum flux. Compared to pre-ALMA single-dish surveys, no significant difference in the CN flux distributions in Lupus and Taurus-Auriga is found, although $\rho$ Ophiuchus disks may be fainter on average. We find ring-shaped CN emission with peak radii of ~50 AU in two resolved disks. We conclude that a large fraction of sources is faint in CN; only exponential gas surface density cutoffs at $R_{c} \leq 15$ AU can reconcile observations with models. This is the first observational evidence of such a compact gas disk population in Lupus. Absolute intensities and the emission morphology of CN are reproduced by DALI models without the need for any continuum substructure; they are unrelated to the CO snowline location. These observations and the successful modeling of these rings provide a new probe of the structure and conditions in disks, and particularly their incident UV radiation field, if disk size is determined by the data.},

  abstract = {Finding solar siblings, that is, stars that formed in the same cluster as the Sun, will yield information about the conditions at the Sun's birthplace. We search for solar sibling candidates in AMBRE, the very large spectra database of solar vicinity stars. Since the ages and chemical abundances of solar siblings are very similar to those of the Sun, we carried out a chemistry- and age-based search for solar sibling candidates. We used high-resolution spectra to derive precise stellar parameters and chemical abundances of the stars. We used these spectroscopic parameters together with Gaia DR2 astrometric data to derive stellar isochronal ages. Gaia data were also used to study the kinematics of the sibling candidates. From the about 17000 stars that are characterized within the AMBRE project, we first selected 55 stars whose metallicities are closest to the solar value (-0.1 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.1 dex). For these stars we derived precise chemical abundances of several iron-peak, alpha- and neutron-capture elements, based on which we selected 12 solar sibling candidates with average abundances and metallicities between -0.03 to 0.03 dex. Our further selection left us with 4 candidates with stellar ages that are compatible with the solar age within observational uncertainties. For the 2 of the hottest candidates, we derived the carbon isotopic ratios, which are compatible with the solar value. HD186302 is the most precisely characterized and probably the most probable candidate of our 4 best candidates. Very precise chemical characterization and age estimation is necessary to identify solar siblings. We propose that in addition to typical chemical tagging, the study of isotopic ratios can give further important information about the relation of sibling candidates with the Sun. Ideally, asteroseismic age determinations of the candidates could solve the problem of imprecise isochronal ages.},

  abstract = {We use self-consistent numerical simulations of the evolution and disruption of the Sun's birth cluster in the Milky Way potential to investigate the present-day phase-space distribution of the Sun's siblings. The simulations include the gravitational N-body forces within the cluster and the effects of stellar evolution on the cluster population. In addition, the gravitational forces due to the Milky Way potential are accounted for in a self-consistent manner. Our aim is to understand how the astrometric and radial velocity data from the Gaia mission can be used to pre-select solar sibling candidates. We vary the initial conditions of the Sun's birth cluster, as well as the parameters of the Galactic potential. In particular, we use different configurations and strengths of the bar and spiral arms. We show that the disruption time-scales of the cluster are insensitive to the details of the non-axisymmetric components of the Milky Way model and we make predictions, averaged over the different simulated possibilities, about the number of solar siblings that should appear in surveys such as Gaia or GALAH. We find a large variety of present-day phase-space distributions of solar siblings, which depend on the cluster initial conditions and the Milky Way model parameters. We show that nevertheless robust predictions can be made about the location of the solar siblings in the space of parallaxes (ϖ), proper motions (μ) and radial velocities (V<SUB>r</SUB>). By calculating the ratio of the number of simulated solar siblings to that of the number of stars in a model Galactic disc, we find that this ratio is above 0.5 in the region given by: ϖ ≥ 5 mas, 4 ≤ μ ≤ 6 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and -2 ≤ V<SUB>r</SUB> ≤ 0 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Selecting stars from this region should increase the probability of success in identifying solar siblings through follow-up observations. However the proposed pre-selection criterion is sensitive to our assumptions, in particular about the Galactic potential. Using a more realistic potential (e.g. including transient spiral structure and molecular clouds) would make the pre-selection of solar sibling candidates based on astrometric and radial velocity data very inefficient. This reinforces the need for large-scale surveys to determine precise astrophysical properties of stars, in particular their ages and chemical abundances, if we want to identify the solar family.},

Sednitos roam the outer regions of the Solar system between the Egeworth-Kuiper belt and the Oort Cloud, in extraordinary wide (a &gt; 150 au) orbits with a large perihelion distance of q &gt; 30 au compared to the Earth's (a ≡ 1 au and eccentricity e ≡ (1 - q/a) ≃ 0.0167 or q ≃ 1 au). This population is composed of a dozen objects, which we consider a family because they have similar perihelion distance and inclination with respect to the ecliptic i = 10°-30°. They also have similar argument of perihelion ω = 340° ± 55°. There is no ready explanation for their origin. Here we show that these orbital parameters are typical for a captured population from the planetesimal disc of another star. Assuming that the orbital elements of Sednitos have not changed since they acquired their orbits, we reconstruct the encounter that led to their capture. We conclude that they might have been captured in a near miss with a 1.8 M<SUB>☉</SUB> star that impacted the Sun at ≃ 340 au at an inclination with respect to the ecliptic of 17°-34° with a relative velocity at infinity of ̃4.3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>.

We imaged five individual fields at 856 μm containing 22 Hubble Space Telescope ( HST )-identified proplyds and detected 21 of them. Eight of those disks were detected for the first time at submillimeter wavelengths, including the most prominent, well-known proplyd in the entire Orion Nebula, 114-426. Thermal dust emission in excess of any free-free component was measured in all but one of the detected disks, and ranged between 1 and 163 mJy, with resulting disk masses of 0.3-79 M jup . An additional 26 stars with no prior evidence of associated disks in HST observations were also imaged within the 5 fields, but only 2 were detected. The disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which include OB stars, θ 1 Ori C, and θ 1 Ori F, range from 0.1 to0.6 M jup . Combining these ALMA data with previous Submillimeter Array observations, we find a lack of massive ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] gsim3 M jup ) disks in the extreme-UV-dominated region of Orion, within 0.03 pc of θ 1 Ori C. At larger separations from θ 1 Ori C, in the far-UV-dominated region, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found in low-mass star forming regions. Taken together, these results suggest that a rapid dissipation of disk masses likely inhibits potential planet formation in the extreme-UV-dominated regions of OB associations, but leaves disks in the far-UV-dominated regions relatively unaffected.},

  volume = {539},
  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201015914},
  abstract = {Context. Circumstellar disks are expected to evolve quickly in massive young clusters harboring many OB-type stars. Two processes have been proposed to drive the disk evolution in such cruel environments: (1) gravitational interaction between circumstellar disks and nearby passing stars (stellar encounters); and (2) photoevaporation by UV photons from massive stars. The relative importance of both mechanisms is not well understood. Studies of massive young star clusters can provide observational constraints on the processes of driving disk evolution. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the properties of young stars and their disks in the NGC 6357 complex, concentrating on the most massive star cluster within the complex: Pismis 24. <BR /> Methods: We use infrared data from the 2MASS and Spitzer GLIMPSE surveys, complemented with our own deep Spitzer imaging of the central regions of Pismis 24, in combination with X-ray data to search for young stellar objects (YSOs) in NGC 6357 complex. The infrared data constrain the disk presence and are complemented by optical photometric and spectroscopic observations, obtained with VLT/VIMOS, that constrain the properties of the central stars. For those stars with reliable spectral types we combine spectra and photometry to estimate the mass and age. For cluster members without reliable spectral types we obtain the mass and age probability distributions from R and I-band photometry, assuming these stars have the same extinction distribution as those in the "spectroscopic" sample. We compare the disk properties in the Pismis 24 cluster with those in other clusters/star-forming regions employing infrared color-color diagrams. <BR /> Results: We discover two new young clusters in the NGC 6357 complex. We give a revised distance estimate for Pismis 24 of 1.7 ± 0.2 kpc. We find that the massive star Pis 24-18 is a binary system, with the secondary being the main X-ray source of the pair. We provide photometry in 9 bands between 0.55 and 9 μm for the members of the Pismis 24 cluster. We derive the cluster mass function and find that up to the completeness limit at low masses it agrees well with the initial mass function of the Trapezium cluster. We derive a median age of 1 Myr for the Pismis 24 cluster members. We find five proplyds in HST archival imaging of the cluster, four of which are newly found. In all cases the proplyd tails are pointing directly away from the massive star system Pis 24-1. One proplyd shows a second tail, pointing away from Pis 24-2, suggesting this object is being photoevaporated from two directions simultaneously. We find that the global disk frequency (~30%) in Pismis 24 is much lower than some other clusters of similar age, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. When comparing the disk frequencies in 19 clusters/star-forming regions of various ages and different (massive) star content, we find that the disks in clusters harboring extremely massive stars (typically earlier than O5), like Pismis 24, are dissipated roughly twice as quickly as in clusters/star-forming regions without extremely massive stars. Within Pismis 24, we find that the disk frequency within a projected distance of 0.6 pc from Pis 24-1 is substantially lower than at larger radii (~19% vs. ~37%). We argue for a combination of photoevaporation and irradiation with ionizing UV photons from nearby massive stars, causing increased MRI-induced turbulence and associated accretion activity, to play an important role in the dissipation of low-mass star disks in Pismis 24.

  abstract = {We present observational evidence of environmental effects on the formation and evolution of planetary systems. We combine catalogues of resolved protoplanetary discs (PPDs) and young stellar objects in the solar neighbourhood to analyse the PPD size distribution as a function of ambient stellar density. By running Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests between the PPD radii at different densities, we find empirical evidence, at the >97% confidence level, for a change in the PPD radius distribution at ambient stellar densities Σ ≳ 103.5
pc-2. This coincides with a simple theoretical estimate for the truncation of PPDs or planetary systems by dynamical encounters. If this agreement is causal, the ongoing disruption of PPDs and planetary systems limits the possible existence of planets in the habitable zone, with shorter lifetimes at higher host stellar masses and ambient densities. Therefore, habitable planets are not likely to be present in long-lived stellar clusters, and may have been ejected altogether to form a population of unbound, free-floating planets. We conclude that, while highly suggestive, our results should be verified through other methods. Our simple model shows that truncations should lead to a measurable depletion of the PPD mass function that can be detected with ALMA observations of the densest nearby and young clusters.

  abstract = {It has recently been noted that many discs around T Tauri stars appear to comprise only a few Jupiter masses of gas and dust. Using millimetre surveys of discs within six local star formation regions, we confirm this result, and find that only a few per cent of young stars have enough circumstellar material to build gas giant planets, in standard core accretion models. Since the frequency of observed exoplanets is greater than this, there is a `missing-mass' problem. As alternatives to simply adjusting the conversion of dust flux to disc mass, we investigate three other classes of solution. Migration of planets could hypothetically sweep up the disc mass reservoir more efficiently, but trends in multiplanet systems do not support such a model, and theoretical models suggest that the gas accretion time-scale is too short for migration to sweep the disc. Enhanced inner-disc mass reservoirs are possible, agreeing with predictions of disc evolution through self-gravity, but not adding to millimetre dust flux as the inner disc is optically thick. Finally, the incidence of massive discs is shown to be higher at the protostellar stages, Classes 0 and I, where discs substantial enough to form planets via core accretion are abundant enough to match the frequency of exoplanets. Gravitational instability may also operate in the Class 0 epoch, where half the objects have potentially unstable discs of &gt;~30 per cent of the stellar mass. However, recent calculations indicate that forming gas giants inside 50 au by instability is unlikely, even in such massive discs. Overall, the results presented suggest that the canonically `protoplanetary' discs of Class II T Tauri stars have globally low masses in dust observable at millimetre wavelengths, and conversion to larger bodies (anywhere from small rocks up to planetary cores) must already have occurred.},

A comparison of planet detection statistics and the measured solid reservoirs in T Tauri discs suggests that planet formation is likely already underway at the few Myr age of the discs in Taurus-Auriga, with a large fraction of solids having been converted into large objects with low millimetre opacity and/or sequestered at small disc radii where they are difficult to detect at millimetre wavelengths.},

  abstract = {We study the hydrodynamic evolution of protostellar disks under the influence of a central source of ionizing radiation and its stellar wind. Here we examine the effects of an important contribution to the diffuse radiation field - the scattering of hydrogen-ionizing photons on dust grains (dust scattering). We present and discuss the resulting changes in the evolution of the system under a variety of conditions both with and without dust scattering. An important consequence is the significant increase in the photoevaporation rate. Depending on the scattering coefficient assumed, the presence of dust within the ionized region can increase the density and flow of ionized material and correspondingly shorten the disk's lifetime by a factor of two or more. In addition, the temperature of the ionized outflowing gas is slightly higher and remains more nearly constant over the extent of the ionized region, even in the regions shadowed from direct stellar radiation. We also investigate the influence of other major parameters of the problem, wind velocity, wind mass loss rate, and stellar ionizing flux, by systematically varying these parameters. Over a large range of values of stellar ionizing flux S_star_ we find a power law dependence of the disk mass loss rate due to photoionization ̇(M)_ph_{prop.to}S_star_^0.58^ which is comparable to analytic estimates. Deviations from this power law occurred for moderate values S_star_&gt;10^47^s^-1^ due to our finite disk size and for low values S_star_&lt;~10^45^s^-1^ due to the resulting non-steady flow pattern. Because we have assumed a warm (T=~10^4^K) wind and have included heating, cooling, ionization, and recombination processes in the stellar wind, we find that the disk's photoevaporation rate depends on the assumed wind parameters in a manner which can be explained by the loss of UV ionizing photons very close to the central star.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the dynamical evolution of young groups/clusters, with N=100-1000 members, from their embedded stage out to ages of ~10 Myr. We use N-body simulations to explore how their evolution depends on the system size N and the initial conditions. Motivated by recent observations suggesting that stellar groups begin their evolution with subvirial speeds, this study compares subvirial starting states with virial starting states. Multiple realizations of equivalent cases (100 simulations per initial condition) are used to build up a robust statistical description of these systems, e.g., the probability distribution of closest approaches, the mass profiles, and the probability distribution for the radial location of cluster members. These results provide a framework from which to assess the effects of groups/clusters on the processes of star and planet formation and to study cluster evolution. The distributions of radial positions are used in conjunction with the probability distributions of the expected far-ultraviolet (FUV) luminosities (calculated here as a function of cluster size N) to determine the radiation exposure of circumstellar disks. The distributions of closest approaches are used in conjunction with scattering cross sections (calculated here as a function of stellar mass using ~10<SUP>5</SUP> Monte Carlo scattering experiments) to determine the probability of disruption for newly formed solar systems. We use the nearby cluster NGC 1333 as a test case in this investigation. The main conclusion of this study is that clusters in this size range have only a modest effect on forming planetary systems. The interaction rates are low, so that the typical solar system experiences a single encounter with closest approach distance b~1000 AU. The radiation exposure is also low, with median FUV flux G<SUB>0</SUB>~900 (1.4 ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>), so that photoevaporation of circumstellar disks is only important beyond 30 AU. Given the low interaction rates and modest radiation levels, we suggest that solar system disruption is a rare event in these clusters.},

  abstract = {Disk winds are thought to play an important role in the evolution and dispersal of planet-forming disks. While high-resolution optical and infrared spectroscopy has identified several disk wind diagnostics, wind mass loss rates remain largely unconstrained mostly due to the lack of spatial resolution to measure the extent of the wind emitting region. Here, we show that the ngVLA will have the sensitivity and resolution to detect and spatially resolve the free-free emission from the fully or partially ionized component of disk winds. Hence, ngVLA observations will be critical to estimate mass loss rates and clarify the role of disk winds in the evolution and dispersal of disk mass.},

  title = {Ionization-Driven Depletion and Redistribution of CO in Protoplanetary Disks},
  abstract = {Based on the interstellar CO/H2 ratio, carbon monoxide-based censuses of protoplanetary disks in Lupus, sigma Orionis, and Chamaeleon I found no disks more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula, which is inconsistent with the existence of exoplanets more massive than Jupiter. Observations and models are converging on the idea that ionization-driven chemistry depletes carbon monoxide in T-Tauri disks. Yet the extent of CO depletion depends on the incident flux of ionizing radiation, and some T-Tauri stars may have winds strong enough to shield their disks from cosmic rays. There is also a range of X-ray luminosities possible for a given stellar mass. Here we use a suite of chemical models, each with a different incident X-ray or cosmic-ray flux, to assess whether CO depletion is a typical outcome for T-Tauri disks. We find that CO dissociation in the outer disk is a robust result for realistic ionization rates, with abundance reductions between 70% and 99.99% over 2 Myr of evolution. Furthermore, after the initial dissociation epoch, the inner disk shows some recovery of the CO abundance from CO2 dissociation. In highly ionized disks, CO recovery in the inner disk combined with depletion in the outer disk creates a centrally peaked CO abundance distribution. The emitting area in rare CO isotopologues may be an indirect ionization indicator: in a cluster of disks with similar ages, those with the most compact CO isotopologue emission see the highest ionization rates.},

We include both the observed distribution of cluster sizes N in the solar neighborhood and an extended distribution that includes clusters with larger N . The paper presents distributions of the FUV and EUV luminosities for clusters with given stellar membership N , distributions of FUV and EUV luminosity convolved over the expected distribution of cluster sizes N , and the corresponding distributions of FUV and EUV fluxes. These flux distributions are calculated both with and without the effects of extinction. Finally, we consider the effects of variations in the stellar initial mass function on these radiation fields. Taken together, these results specify the distributions of radiation environments that forming solar systems are expected to experience.},

Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects,
including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than ˜100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than
˜104M⊙; the size of the cluster and its
environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and
computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

  abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 1.1 mm dust continuum and CO 2-1 emission toward six dense cores within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. We detect compact, sub-arcsecond continuum structures toward three targets, two of which (Oph A N6 and SM1) are located in the Ophiuchus A ridge. Two targets, SM1 and GSS 30, contain two compact sources within the ALMA primary beam. We argue that several of the compact structures are small ($R \lesssim 80$ au) accretion disks around young protostars, due to their resolved, elongated structures, coincident radio and x-ray detections, or bipolar outflow detections. While CO line wings extend to $\pm 10-20$ km s$^{-1}$ for the more evolved sources GSS 30 IRS3 and IRS1, CO emission toward other sources, where detected, only extends a few km s$^{-1}$ from the cloud $v_\mathrm{LSR}$. The dust spectral index toward the compact objects suggests that the disks are either optically thick at 1.1 mm, or that significant grain growth has already occurred. We identify, for the first time, a single compact continuum source ($R \sim 100$ au) toward N6 embedded within a larger continuum structure. SM1N is extended in the continuum but is highly centrally concentrated, with a density profile that follows a $r^{-1.3}$ power law within 200 au, and additional structure suggested by the uv-data. Both N6 and SM1N show no clear bipolar outflows with velocities greater than a few km s$^{-1}$ from the cloud velocity. These sources are candidates to be the youngest protostars or first hydrostatic cores in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud.},

For this sample of 336 stars, we observe 3 mm emission above the 3 σ noise level toward 10 sources, six of which have also been detected optically in silhouette against the bright nebular background. In addition, we detect 20 objects in 3 mm continuum emission that do not correspond to known near-IR cluster members. Comparisons of our measured fluxes with longer wavelength observations enable rough separation of dust emission from thermal free-free emission, and we find substantial dust emission toward most objects. For the sample of 10 objects detected at both 3 mm and near-IR wavelengths, eight exhibit substantial dust emission. Excluding the two high-mass stars (θ<SUP>1</SUP> Ori A and the BN object) and assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100, we estimate circumstellar masses ranging from 0.13 to 0.39 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. For the cluster members not detected at 3 mm, images of individual objects are stacked to constrain the mean 3 mm flux of the ensemble. The average flux is detected at the 3 σ confidence level and implies an average disk mass of 0.005 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, comparable to the minimum-mass solar nebula. The percentage of stars in Orion surrounded by disks more massive than ~0.1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> is consistent with the disk mass distribution in Taurus, and we argue that massive disks in Orion do not appear to be truncated through close encounters with high-mass stars. Comparison of the average disk mass and number of massive dusty structures in Orion with similar surveys of the NGC 2024 and IC 348 clusters is used to constrain the evolutionary timescales of massive circumstellar disks in clustered environments.},

  abstract = {Context: The external destruction of protoplanetary discs in a clustered environment acts mainly due to two mechanisms: gravitational drag by stellar encounters and evaporation by strong stellar winds and radiation. It is a fundamental question whether either of these mechanisms is important for the stellar evolution and planet formation process in young star clusters. <BR />Aims: We focus on the effect of stellar encounters in young dense clusters and investigate whether there are any observables that could trace this mechanism and its impact on disc evolution. If encounters play a role in disc destruction, one would expect that stars devoid of disc material would show unexpectedly high velocities as an outcome of close interactions. We want to quantify this effect by numerical simulations and compare it to observations. <BR />Methods: As a model cluster we chose the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We reanalyzed observational data of the ONC to find encounter signatures in the velocity distribution and a possible correlation with signatures of circumstellar discs. We use the ++ code to model the dynamics of an ONC-like cluster and analyze the velocity distribution and the disc-mass loss due to encounters. <BR />Results: We found from the observational data that 8 to 18 stars leave the ONC with velocities several times the velocity dispersion. The majority of these high-velocity stars are young low-mass stars (t ≲ 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr, m ≈ 0.2-0.3 M<SUB>☉</SUB>), among them several lacking infrared excess emission. Interestingly, the high-velocity stars are found only in two separate regions of the ONC - i) close to the cluster centre and ii) in the outer cluster region. Our simulations give an explanation for the location of the high-velocity stars and provide evidence for a strong correlation between location and disc destruction. <BR />Conclusions: The high-velocity stars can be explained as the outcome of close three-body encounters; the partial lack of disc signatures is attributed to gravitational interaction. The spatial distribution of the high-velocity stars reflects the initial structure and dynamics of the ONC. Our approach can be generalized to study the evolution of other young dense star clusters, like the Arches cluster, back in time.},

  abstract = {Context: HD 141569, a triple star system, has been intensively observed and studied because of its massive debris disk. Until recently, it was regarded as a gravitationally bound triple system but recent measurements of the HD 141569A radial velocity seem to invalidate this hypothesis. The flyby scenario therefore has to be further investigated to test its compatibility with the observed disk structures. Aims: We present a study of the flyby scenario for the HD 141569 system by considering 3 variants: a sole flyby, a flyby associated with one planet embedded in the disk and a flyby with two planets in the disk. We discuss the merits of each one to reproduce the scattered light observations of the disk. Methods: We first use analytical calculations to reduce the parameter space of the 2 stellar companion orbit and then perform N-body numerical simulations of the flyby encounter using symplectic integration, taking into account the gravitational influence of the stars and the planets on massless test particles. Results: The binary orbit is found to be almost fixed by the observational constraint on an edge-on plane with respect to the observers. If the binary had an influence on the disk structure, it should have a passing time at the periapsis between 5000 and 8000 years ago and a distance at periapsis between 600 and 900 AU. It also appears that the best scenario to reproduce the disk morphology is a flyby with 1 planet embedded in the disk. For a 2 MJ planet, its orbital eccentricity must be around 0.2 while for a 8 MJ planet, it must be below 0.1. In the two cases, its apoapsis is about 130 AU. Conclusions: Although the global disk shape is reasonably well reproduced, some observed features cannot be explained by the present model and the likehood of the flyby event remains an issue for the scenario explored in this paper. Dynamically speaking, HD 141569 is still a puzzling system.},

  abstract = {Context. Proto-planetary disks are thought to provide the initial 
environment for planetary system formation. The dust and gas
distribution and its evolution with time is one of the key elements in
the process. Aims: We attempt to characterize the radial
distribution of dust in disks around a sample of young stars from an
observational point of view, and, when possible, in a model-independent
way, by using parametric laws. Methods: We used the IRAM PdBI
interferometer to provide very high angular resolution (down to 0.4'' in
some sources) observations of the continuum at 1.3 mm and 3 mm around a
sample of T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga region. The sample includes
single and multiple systems, with a total of 23 individual disks. We
used track-sharing observing mode to minimize the biases. We fitted
these data with two kinds of models: a "truncated power law" model and a
model presenting an exponential decay at the disk edge ("viscous"
model). Results: Direct evidence for tidal truncation is found in
the multiple systems. The temperature of the mm-emitting dust is
constrained in a few systems. Unambiguous evidence for large grains is
obtained by resolving out disks with very low values of the dust
emissivity index β. In most disks that are sufficiently resolved at
two different wavelengths, we find a radial dependence of β, which
appears to increase from low values (as low as 0) at the center to about
1.7-2 at the disk edge. The same behavior could apply to all studied
disks. It introduces further ambiguities in interpreting the brightness
profile, because the regions with apparent β ≈ 0 can also be
interpreted as being optically thick when their brightness temperature
is high enough. Despite the added uncertainty on the dust absorption
coefficient, the characteristic size of the disk appears to increase
with a higher estimated star age. Conclusions: These results
provide the first direct evidence of the radial dependence of the grain
size in proto-planetary disks. Constraints of the surface density
distributions and their evolution remain ambiguous because of a
degeneracy with the β(r) law.

  abstract = {Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely unharmed beyond 10 . However, their compactness means a high stellar density, which can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young stars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on potentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these strong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties of planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact high-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the gas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate on the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations show that in high-mass open clusters 80%─90% of all disks/planetary systems should be smaller than 50 just as a result of the strong stellar interactions in these environments. Already in the initial phases, three to four close flybys lead to typical disk sizes within the range of 18─27 . Afterward, the disk sizes are altered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation that the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB association, NGC 2362, and h/χPersei are at least three times smaller in size than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed planetary systems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those found around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to be extremely rare in such environments.},

  doi = {10.3847/1538-4357/aad23c},
  abstract = {The planets of our solar system formed from a gas-dust disk. However, there are some properties of the solar system that are peculiar in this context. First, the cumulative mass of all objects beyond Neptune (trans-Neptunian objects [TNOs]) is only a fraction of what one would expect. Second, unlike the planets themselves, the TNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly on inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This implies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its formation. However, some of the TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the zone of influence of the planets. Thus, external forces must have played an important part in the restructuring of the outer solar system. The study presented here shows that a close fly-by of a neighboring star can simultaneously lead to the observed lower mass density outside 30 au and excite the TNOs onto eccentric, inclined orbits, including the family of Sednoids. In the past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant development stage. However, our numerical simulations show that such a scenario is much more likely than previously anticipated. A fly-by also naturally explains the puzzling fact that Neptune has a higher mass than Uranus. Our simulations suggest that many additional Sednoids at high inclinations still await discovery, perhaps including bodies like the postulated planet X.},

Our survey gives a detailed look at disk survivability within the hot-star-dominated environment in this cavity. Using mid-infrared two-color diagrams ([3.6]-[4.5] vs. [5.8]-[8.0]), we identified 337 class II and 25 class I objects out of 1084 objects detected in all four of these bands with photometric uncertainty better than 10%. Including the 24 μm data, we found 213 class II and 20 class I sources out of 279 stars also detected at this latter band. The center of the class II density contours is in very good agreement with the center of the cluster detected in the 2MASS images. We studied the distribution of the class II sources relative to the O stars and found that the effect of high-mass stars on the circumstellar disks is significant only in their immediate vicinity.},

  abstract = {Context: The observation of young stars with circumstellar disks 
suggests that the disks are dissipated, starting from the inner region,
by the radiation of the central star and eventually by the formation of
rocky planetesimals, over a time scale of several million years. It was
also shown that strong UV radiation emitted by nearby massive stars can
heat a circumstellar disk up to some thousand degrees, inducing the
photoevaporation of the gas. This process strongly reduces the
dissipation time scale. Aims: We study whether there exists a
correlation between the spatial distribution of stars with circumstellar
disks and the position of massive stars with spectral class earlier than
B5, in the open cluster NGC 6611. Methods: We created a multiband
catalog of the cluster, down to V˜ 23^m, using optical data from a
WFI observation at 2.2 m of ESO in the BVI bands, the 2MASS public point
source catalog and an archival X-ray observation made with CHANDRA/ACIS.
We selected the stars with infrared excess (due to the emission of a
circumstellar disk) using suitable color indices independent of
extinction, and studied their spatial distribution. Results: The
spatial distribution of the stars with K band excess (due to the
presence of a circumstellar disk) is anti correlated with that of the
massive stars: the disks are more frequent at large distances from these
stars. We argue that this is in agreement with the hypothesis that the
circumstellar disks are heated by the UV radiation from the massive
stars and photoevaporated.

clear proof of the role of externally induced photoevaporation in the

for study of disk photoevaporation, due to its significant population of
massive members and stars with disk. In a previous paper, we obtained
evidence of the influence of the strong UV field generated by the
massive cluster members on the evolution of disks around low-mass
Pre-Main Sequence members. Our study was based on a multiband BVIJHK and

of 33'×34' centered on the cluster, we select the candidate
members with disks of NGC 6611 using IRAC color-color diagrams and
suitable reddening-free color indices. Using the X-ray data to select
Class III cluster members, we also estimate disks frequency relative to
the intensity of the incident radiation emitted by massive members. Results: We identify 458 candidate members with circumstellar disks,
among which 146 had not been discovered previously. By comparing all
color indices used to select cluster members with disk, we claim that
these indices measure the excess of radiation due to the emission of the
same physical region of the disk (i.e. the inner rim at the dust
sublimation radius). Our new results confirm that UV radiation from
massive stars affects the evolution of nearby circumstellar disks.

  doi = {10.1086/307055},
  abstract = {We have modeled the neutral flows emerging from circumstellar disks or small clumps of size r<SUB>0</SUB> illuminated by an external source of ultraviolet radiation. The models are applied to the disks (proplyds) in the Orion Nebula, most of which are illuminated by θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori. Our models improve upon the simpler models of Johnstone, Hollenbach, &amp; Ballyby including the results of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium photodissociation region (PDR) codes, and by treating the flow speed off the disk surface in a more consistent manner. We present a study that delineates the parameter space (G<SUB>0</SUB>, r<SUB>0</SUB>, and σ<SUB>ext</SUB>) in which far-ultraviolet (FUV)-dominated, as opposed to extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)-dominated, flows exist. G<SUB>0</SUB> is the FUV (6 eV&lt;hν&lt;13.6 eV) flux (in units of the local average interstellar flux) incident on the neutral flow at the ionization front (IF), and σ<SUB>ext</SUB> is the dust FUV extinction cross section per H nucleus in the flow region. FUV-dominated flows are extended with sizes of the IF r<SUB>IF</SUB>&gt;~2r<SUB>0</SUB>, have a shock between the disk surface and IF, and the mass-loss rates are determined by FUV photons. For σ<SUB>ext</SUB>=8×10<SUP>-22</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP> and a UV source similar to θ<SUP>1</SUP> C Ori, the FUV-dominated region extends from G<SUB>0</SUB>~5×10<SUP>4</SUP> to G<SUB>0</SUB>~2×10<SUP>7</SUP> (or distances from θ<SUP>1</SUP> C Ori of 0.3-0.01 pc), for disk or clump size of r<SUB>0</SUB>~10<SUP>14</SUP>-10<SUP>15</SUP> cm. Outside this parameter space, hydrogen-ionizing EUV photons dominate the photoevaporation, and the IF is close to the disk surface (r<SUB>IF</SUB>&lt;~2r<SUB>0</SUB>). We show that FUV-dominated flows can explain the observed sizes of the ionization fronts around many of the photoevaporating disks in Orion. The size of the neutral flow region, r<SUB>IF</SUB>, depends mainly on r<SUB>0</SUB>, G<SUB>0</SUB>, and σ<SUB>ext</SUB> inside the flow region. Using ten objects in Orion for which both r<SUB>0</SUB> and r<SUB>IF</SUB> are directly observed, and for which G<SUB>0</SUB> can be estimated from the observed projected distance of the proplyd from θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori, we find that σ<SUB>ext</SUB>~8×10<SUP>-22</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP> best fits the observations. In these models, the disk mass-loss rates are roughly 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. We have determined the disk masses for circular and radial proplyd orbits. For circular orbits around θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori, the disk masses range between 0.005 and 0.04 (t<SUB>i</SUB>/10<SUP>5</SUP> yr) M<SUB>solar</SUB>, where t<SUB>i</SUB> is the illumination timescale. Comparison with millimeter observations of the disk masses (&lt;~0.02 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) indicate t<SUB>i</SUB>~10<SUP>5</SUP> yr, suggesting that θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori is a young (&lt;~10<SUP>5</SUP> yr old) O star in this scenario. The timescale for the disks to significantly lose mass and shrink is ~10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. If the disks cross the Trapezium cluster on radial orbits, the proplyd masses range between 0.002 and 0.01 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. For radial orbits, the lifetime of the proplyds can be as large as the age of the Orion Cluster (~1 Myr), and θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori can be significantly older than 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. We have calculated the thermal and chemical structure of the flow region in the observationally best studied object HST 182-413 (HST 10) and the representative object HST 155-338. A region of atomic hydrogen extends from the IF toward the disk surface, but close to the surface hydrogen becomes molecular. The temperatures inside the atomic layer are several thousand K. We have calculated the H<SUB>2</SUB> 1-0 S(1) and the H<SUB>2</SUB> 2-1 S(1) vibrational line intensities, the [C II] 158 μm and [O I] 63 μm fine-structure line intensities, and the [O I] 6300 Å line intensity. We find good agreement between the observed H<SUB>2</SUB> 1-0 S(1) line intensity and the theoretically predicted one. The models can also reproduce the [O I] 6300 Å line emission observed close to the disk surface in HST 182-413, HST 155-338, and the other proplyds where the disks can be resolved in the [O I] line. The other lines are not yet observed; we present them here as predictions for future observations.},

  abstract = {Protoplanets can produce structures in protoplanetary disks via gravitational disk-planet interactions. Once detected, such structures serve as signposts of planet formation. Here we investigate the kinematic signatures in disks produced by multi-Jupiter mass ($M_{\rm J}$) planets using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations. Such a planet opens a deep gap, and drives transonic vertical motions inside. Such motions include both a bulk motion of the entire half-disk column, and turbulence on scales comparable to and smaller than the scale height. They significantly broaden molecular lines from the gap, producing double-peaked line profiles at certain locations, and a kinematic velocity dispersion comparable to thermal after azimuthal averaging. The same planet does not drive fast vertical motions outside the gap, except at the inner spiral arms and the disk surface. Searching for line broadening induced by multi-$M_{\rm J}$ planets inside gaps requires an angular resolution comparable to the gap width, an assessment of the gap gas temperature to within a factor of 2, and a high sensitivity needed to detect line emission from the gap.},

  abstract = {We explore ultraviolet switch models for the dispersal of circumstellar discs in T Tauri stars that involve both photoevaporation by the central star and viscous evolution. We show that in combination these processes generate the observed `two-time-scale' behaviour for the dispersal of such discs, whereby the disc is rapidly dispersed at the end of its life on a time-scale that is a small fraction of the disc lifetime. This switch is activated when the accretion rate through the disc declines to a low level (a few times 10<SUP>-10</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) such that it roughly matches the rate of photoevaporative mass loss from the disc outside 5-10au. At this point, the inner disc is deprived of further replenishment from larger radii and empties on to the central star on its own short viscous time-scale. This causes the rapid (~10<SUP>5</SUP>-yr) decline in accretion rate on to the central star and in all disc-related emission shortward of 10μm. We discuss the implications of this model for the detection of millimetre emission around weak-line T Tauri stars, and also point out the consequences of such a sudden draining for planet formation in the inner regions of circumstellar discs.},

Comparison with Keplerian models indicates that the RW Aur A disk is the smallest detected so far around a T Tauri star (radius 40-57 AU) and that the CO emitting layer at the outer edge is warmer than the dust ( K) and relatively thick (). The morphology and kinematics of the detected features strongly suggest that we are witnessing tidal stripping of the primary disk by the recent fly-by of RW Aur B. We speculate that tidal dissipation might explain the warmer gas temperatures in the RW Aur A disk compared with typical T Tauri stars, and perhaps play a role in its elevated accretion rate. We also find that the rotation sense of the RW Aur A disk is opposite to transverse velocity shifts in the optical jet reported by Woitas et al. (2005, A&A, 432, 149). We argue that these transverse shifts are likely to represent only upper limits to the true jet rotation speed. The limits remain consistent with current models of MHD launching from the disk.},

  abstract = {Context. One mechanism for the external destruction of protoplanetary discs in young dense clusters is tidal disruption during the flyby of another cluster member. The degree of mass loss in such an encounter depends, among other parameters, on the distribution of the material within the disc. Previous work showed that this is especially so in encounters that truncate large parts of the outer disc. The expectation is that the number of completely destroyed discs in a cluster also depends on the mass distribution within the discs. <BR /> Aims: Here we test this hypothesis by determining the influence of encounters on the disc fraction and average disc mass in clusters of various stellar densities for different mass distributions in the discs. <BR /> Methods: This is done by performing nbody6simulations of a variety of cluster environments, where we track the encounter dynamics and determine the mass loss due to these encounters for different disc-mass distributions. <BR /> Results: We find that although the disc-mass distribution has a significant impact on the disc losses for specific star-disc encounters, the overall disc frequency generally remains unaffected. The reason is that in single encounters the dependence on the mass distribution is strongest if both stars have very different masses. Such encounters are rather infrequent in sparse clusters. In dense clusters these encounters are more common; however, here the disc frequency is largely determined by encounters between low-mass stars such that the overall disc frequency does not change significantly. <BR /> Conclusions: For tidal disruption the disc destruction in clusters is fairly independent of the actual distribution of the material in the disc. The all determining factor remains the cluster density.},

  abstract = {We explore how measurements of protoplanetary disc masses and accretion rates provided by surveys of star-forming regions can be analysed via the dimensionless accretion parameter, which we define as the product of the accretion rate and stellar age divided by the disc mass. By extending and generalizing the study of Jones et al., we demonstrate that this parameter should be less than or of order unity for a wide range of evolutionary scenarios, rising above unity only during the final stages of outside-in clearing by external photoevaporation. We use this result to assess the reliability of disc mass estimates derived from CO isotopologues and sub-mm continuum emission by examining the distribution of accretion efficiencies in regions that are not subject to external photoevaporation. We find that while dust-based mass estimates produce results compatible with theoretical expectations assuming a canonical dust-to-gas ratio, the systematically lower CO-based estimates yield accretion efficiencies significantly above unity in contrast with the theory. This finding provides additional evidence that CO-based disc masses are an underestimate, in line with arguments that have been made on the basis of chemical modelling of relatively small samples. On the other hand, we demonstrate that dust-based mass estimates are sufficiently accurate to reveal distinctly higher accretion efficiencies in the Trapezium cluster, where this result is expected, given the evident importance of external photoevaporation. We therefore propose the dimensionless accretion parameter as a new diagnostic of external photoevaporation in other star-forming regions.},

  abstract = {Most stars do not form in isolation, but as part of a star cluster or association. These young stars are initially surrounded by protoplanetary discs. In these cluster environments tidal interactions with other cluster members can alter the disc properties. Besides the disc frequency, its mass, angular momentum, and energy, the disc's size is particularly prone to being changed by a passing star. So far the change in disc size has only been investigated for a small number of very specific encounters. Several studies investigated the effect of the cluster environment on the sizes of planetary systems like our own solar system, based on a generalisation of information from this limited sample. We performed numerical simulations covering the wide parameter space typical of young star clusters, to test the validity of this approach. Here the sizes of discs after encounters are presented, based on a size definition that is comparable to the one used in observational studies. We find that, except for encounters between equal-mass stars, the usually applied estimates are insufficient. They tend to severely overestimate the remaining disc size. We show that the disc size after an encounter can be described by a relatively simple dependence on the periastron distance and the mass ratio of the encounter partners. This knowledge allows us, for example, to pin down the types of encounter possibly responsible for the structure of today's solar system.

  abstract = {We present 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of protoplanetary discs undergoing a flyby by a stellar perturber on a parabolic orbit lying in a plane inclined relative to the disc mid-plane. We model the disc as a mixture of gas and dust, with grains ranging from 1 $\mathrm{\mu}$m to 10 cm in size. Exploring different orbital inclinations, periastron distances and mass ratios, we investigate the disc dynamical response during and after the flyby. We find that flybys induce evolving spiral structure in both gas and dust which can persist for thousands of years after periastron. Gas and dust structures induced by the flyby differ because of drag-induced effects on the dust grains. Variations in the accretion rate by up to an order of magnitude occur over a time-scale of order 10 years or less, inducing FU Orionis-like outbursts. The remnant discs are truncated and warped. The dust disc is left more compact than the gas disc, both because of disc truncation and accelerated radial drift of grains induced by the flyby.},

All four methods have been proposed in the literature as techniques for quantifying mass segregation, yet they routinely produce contradictory results as they do not all measure the same thing. We apply each method to synthetic star-forming regions to determine when and why they have shortcomings. When a star-forming region is smooth and centrally concentrated, all four methods correctly identify mass segregation when it is present. However, if the region is spatially substructured, the \$$\backslash$Omega\_\{$\backslash$rm GSR\}\$ method fails because it arbitrarily defines groups in the hierarchical distribution, and usually discards positional information for many of the most massive stars in the region. We also show that the \$$\backslash$Lambda\_\{$\backslash$rm MSR\}\$ and \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$rm LDR\}\$ methods can sometimes produce apparently contradictory results, because they use different definitions of mass segregation. We conclude that only \$$\backslash$Lambda\_\{$\backslash$rm MSR\}\$ measures mass segregation in the classical sense (without the need for defining the centre of the region), although \$$\backslash$Sigma\_\{$\backslash$rm LDR\}\$ does place limits on the amount of previous dynamical evolution in a star-forming region.},

  abstract = {Context. Investigations of mass segregation are of vital interest for the understanding of the formation and dynamical evolution of stellar systems on a wide range of spatial scales. A consistent analysis requires a robust measure among different objects and well-defined comparison with theoretical expectations. Various methods have been used for this purpose but usually with limited significance, quantifiability, and application to both simulations and observations. \\
 Aims: We aim at developing a measure of mass segregation with as few parameters as possible, robustness against peculiar configurations, independence of mass determination, simple implementation, stable algorithm, and that is equally well adoptable for data from either simulations or observations. \\
 Methods: Our method is based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) that serves as a geometry-independent measure of concentration. Compared to previous such approaches we obtain a significant refinement by using the geometrical mean as an intermediate-pass. \\
 Results: The geometrical mean boosts the sensitivity compared to previous applications of the MST. It thus allows the detection of mass segregation with much higher confidence and for much lower degrees of mass segregation than other approaches. The method shows in particular very clear signatures even when applied to small subsets of the entire population. We confirm with high significance strong mass segregation of the five most massive stars in the Orion nebula cluster (ONC). \\
 Conclusions: Our method is the most sensitive general measure of mass segregation so far and provides robust results for both data from simulations and observations. As such it is ideally suited for tracking mass segregation in young star clusters and to investigate the long standing paradigm of primordial mass segregation by comparison of simulations and observations.},

The distribution of separations p(s) is considered, and the normalized correlation length (i.e. the mean separation between stars, divided by the overall radius of the cluster) is shown to be a robust indicator of the extent to which a smooth cluster is centrally concentrated. For spherical clusters having volume-density n\textasciitilde{}r\textsuperscript{-$\alpha$} (with $\alpha$ between 0 and 2) decreases monotonically with $\alpha$, from \textasciitilde{}0.8 to \textasciitilde{}0.6.

We compare this velocity dispersion to the theoretically expected value for the velocity dispersion if a region were in virial equilibrium, $\sigma$\textsubscript{vir} and thus assess the virial state ($\sigma$/$\sigma$\textsubscript{vir}) of these systems. We find that in regions that are initially subvirial, or in global virial equilibrium but subvirial on local scales, the system relaxes to virial equilibrium within several million years, or roughly 25-50 crossing times, according to the measured virial ratio. However, the measured velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, appears to be a bad diagnostic of the current virial state of these systems as it suggests that they become supervirial when compared to the velocity dispersion estimated from the virial mass, $\sigma$\textsubscript{vir}. We suggest that this discrepancy is caused by the fact that the regions are never fully relaxed, and that the early non-equilibrium evolution is imprinted in the one-dimensional velocity dispersion at these early epochs. If measured early enough (\&lt;2 Myr in our simulations, or \~20 crossing times), the velocity dispersion can be used to determine whether a region was highly supervirial at birth without the risk of degeneracy. We show that combining $\sigma$, or the ratio of $\sigma$ to the interquartile range (IQR) dispersion, with measures of spatial structure, places stronger constraints on the dynamical history of a region than using the velocity dispersion in isolation.},

The amount of dynamical mass segregation measured by Lambda\_MSR is generally only significant for subvirial and virialised, substructured regions - which usually evolve to form bound clusters. The Sigma\_LDR method shows that massive stars attain higher local densities than the median value in all regions, even those that are supervirial and evolve to form (unbound) associations. We also introduce the Q-Sigma\_LDR plot, which describes the evolution of spatial structure as a function of mass-weighted local density in a star forming region. Initially dense ($>$1000 stars pc\^\{-2\}), bound regions always have Q $>$1, Sigma\_LDR $>$ 2 after 5Myr, whereas dense unbound regions always have Q $<$ 1, Sigma\_LDR $>$ 2 after 5Myr. Less dense regions ($<$100 stars pc\^\{-2\}) do not usually exhibit Sigma\_LDR $>$ 2 values, and if relatively high local density around massive stars arises purely from dynamics, then the Q-Sigma\_LDR plot can be used to estimate the initial density of a star forming region.},

We present a new algorithm for statistically analysing the distribution of stars to quantify the level of substructure. We suggest that, even at the simplest level, the internal structure of a fractal cluster requires the specification of three parameters. (I) The 3D fractal dimension, D, measures the extent to which the clusters on one level of the nested hierarchy fill the volume of their parent cluster. (II) The number of levels, L, reflects the finite ratio between the linear size of the large root-cluster at the top of the hierarchy, and the smallest leaf-clusters at the bottom of the hierarchy. (III) The volume-density scaling exponent, C = -d ln [$\delta$ n]/d ln [L] measures the factor by which the excess density, $\delta$n, in a structure of scale L, exceeds that of the background formed by larger structures; it is similar, but not exactly equivalent, to the exponent in Larson's scaling relation between density and size for molecular clouds. We describe an algorithm that can be used to constrain the values of (D,L,C) and apply this method to artificial and observed clusters. We show that this algorithm is able to reliably describe the three-dimensional structure of an artificial star cluster from the two-dimensional projection, and quantify the varied structures observed in real and simulated clusters.},

We find that the minimum spanning tree method reflects more the compactness, which represents the global spatial distribution of massive stars, while the local stellar density method reflects more the crowdedness, which provides the local gravitational potential information. It is suggested to measure the local and the global mass segregation simultaneously. We also develop a hybrid method that takes both aspects into account. This hybrid method balances the local and the global mass segregation in the sense that the predominant one is either caused by dynamical evolution or purely accidental, especially when such information is unknown a priori. In addition, we test our prescriptions with numerical models and show the impact of binaries in estimating the mass segregation value. As an application, we use these methods on the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) observations and the Taurus cluster. We find that the ONC is significantly mass segregated down to the 20th most massive stars. In contrast, the massive stars of the Taurus cluster are sparsely distributed in many different subclusters, showing a low degree of compactness. The massive stars of Taurus are also found to be distributed in the high-density region of the subclusters, showing significant mass segregation at subcluster scales. Meanwhile, we also apply these methods to discuss the possible mechanisms of the dynamical evolution of the simulated substructured star clusters.},

Here we address this issue by systematically characterizing the internal spatial structure of 16 open clusters in the Milky Way spanning a wide range of ages. Cluster stars have been selected from a membership probability analysis based on a nonparametric method that uses both positions and proper motions and does not make any a priori assumption on the underlying distributions. The internal structure is then characterized by means of the minimum spanning tree method (Q parameter), King profile fitting, and the correlation dimension (D\textsubscript{c} ) for those clusters with fractal patterns. On average, clusters with fractal-like structure are younger than those exhibiting radial star density profiles and an apparent trend between Q and age is observed in agreement with previous ideas about the dynamical evolution of the internal spatial structure of stellar clusters. However, some new results are obtained from a more detailed analysis: (1) a clear correlation between Q and the concentration parameter of the King model for those cluster with radial density profiles, (2) the presence of spatial substructure in clusters as old as \textasciitilde{}100 Myr, and (3) a significant correlation between fractal dimension and age for those clusters with internal substructure. Moreover, the lowest fractal dimensions seem to be considerably smaller than the average value measured in galactic molecular cloud complexes.},

We find that the $\Sigma$ distribution is degenerate, in the sense that many different cluster morphologies (smooth or substructured) produce similar cumulative distributions. However, when used in tandem with a measure of structure, such as the Q-parameter, the current spatial and dynamical state of a star cluster can be inferred. The effect of cluster dynamics on the $\Sigma$ distribution and the Q-parameter is investigated using N-body simulations and we find that, depending on the assumed initial conditions, the $\Sigma$ distribution can rapidly evolve from high to low densities in less than 5 Myr. This suggests that the $\Sigma$ distribution can only be used to assess the current density of a star-forming region, and provides little information on its initial density. However, if the $\Sigma$ distribution is used together with the Q-parameter, then information on the amount of substructure can be used as a proxy to infer the amount of dynamical evolution that has taken place. Substructure is erased quickly through dynamics, which can disrupt binary star systems and planets, as well as facilitate dynamical mass segregation. Therefore, dynamical processing in young star-forming regions could still be significant, even without currently observed high densities.},

  title = {The Imprint of {{X}}-Ray Photoevaporation of Planet-Forming Discs on the Orbital Distribution of Giant Planets},
  abstract = {High energy radiation from a planet host star can have strong influence on the final habitability of a system through several mechanisms. In this context we have constructed a catalogue containing the X-ray luminosities, as well as basic stellar and planetary properties of all known stars hosting giant planets ($>$ 0.1 Mjup) that have been observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton and/or ROSAT. Specifically in this paper we present a first application of this catalogue to search for a possible imprint of X-ray photoevaporation of planet-forming discs on the present-day orbital distribution of the observed giant planets. We found a suggestive void in the semi-major axis, a, versus X-ray luminosity, Lx, plane, roughly located between a \textasciitilde{} 0.05-1 au and Lx \textasciitilde{}10\^27-10\^29 erg/s, which would be expected if photoevaporation played a dominant role in the migration history of these systems. However, due to the small observational sample size, the statistical significance of this feature cannot be proven at this point.},

  title = {Photoevaporation of Protostellar Disks. {{IV}}. {{Externally}} Illuminated Disks},
  volume = {340},
  abstract = {By means of numerical simulations we investigate the photoevaporation of protostellar disks. Here we concentrate on the evolution of disks under the influence of an external Lyman continuum radiation field. The morphological evolution is illustrated in detail for the case of a relatively massive disk exposed to a modest ionizing flux. Cometary tails develop and break off into filaments which leave the immediate vicinity of the disk with the evaporating flow. It evolves into a relatively undisturbed disk completely enveloped by the ionization front. A low mass star-disk system is used to investigate the dependence of the evolution on the distance from the ionizing source. Distances and external Euv flux are adapted to the situation of the proplyds close to the Trapezium star theta (1) Ori C. The low-mass system becomes extremely deformed through the asymmetrical illumination. The total mass of the disk fragments which break off during the cometary phase ( \textasciitilde{} 2*E(4) yr) is of order 10\% of the disk mass. With decreasing distance the densest parts of the disk remnant are more strongly disturbed. The dependence of the final photoevaporation rate on the distance dot \{M\}\_ph\textasciitilde{} d(-1.1) is consistent with analytical models. For comparison with observations we use a 3D ray-tracing procedure to calculate spectra, continuum maps and H$\alpha$ line profiles. During the cometary phase the elongated tails of the low mass system are recognizable at almost all frequencies ranging from the radio region to the near-infrared. Furthermore, the disk remnants viewed face-on from the direction of the source appear as round heads in H$\alpha$ resembling this class of proplyds quite well.},

The COCOA code is being developed to quickly compare results of numerical simulations of star clusters with observational data. We use COCOA to obtain parameters of the projected cluster model. For comparison, a FITS file of the projected cluster was provided to observers so that they could use their observational methods and techniques to obtain cluster parameters. The results show that the similarity of cluster parameters obtained through numerical simulations and observations depends significantly on the quality of observational data and photometric accuracy.},

  volume = {475},

  abstract = {We introduce and present results from the COCOA (Cluster simulatiOn Comparison with ObservAtions) code that has been developed to create idealized mock photometric observations using results from numerical simulations of star cluster evolution. COCOA is able to present the output of realistic numerical simulations of star clusters carried out using Monte Carlo or N-body codes in a way that is useful for direct comparison with photometric observations. In this paper, we describe the COCOA code and demonstrate its different applications by utilizing globular cluster (GC) models simulated with the MOCCA (MOnte Carlo Cluster simulAtor) code. COCOA is used to synthetically observe these different GC models with optical telescopes, perform point spread function photometry, and subsequently produce observed colour-magnitude diagrams. We also use COCOA to compare the results from synthetic observations of a cluster model that has the same age and metallicity as the Galactic GC NGC 2808 with observations of the same cluster carried out with a 2.2 m optical telescope. We find that COCOA can effectively simulate realistic observations and recover photometric data. COCOA has numerous scientific applications that maybe be helpful for both theoreticians and observers that work on star clusters. Plans for further improving and developing the code are also discussed in this paper.},

  abstract = {The extent to which the projected distribution of stars in a cluster is due to a large-scale radial gradient, and the extent to which it is due to fractal substructure, can be quantified - statistically - using the measure ?. Here ? is the normalized mean edge length of its minimum spanning tree (i.e. the shortest network of edges connecting all stars in the cluster) and ? is the correlation length (i.e. the normalized mean separation between all pairs of stars). We show how ? can be indirectly applied to grey-scale images by decomposing the image into a distribution of points from which ? and ? can be calculated. This provides a powerful technique for comparing the distribution of dense gas in a molecular cloud with the distribution of the stars that condense out of it. We illustrate the application of this technique by comparing ? values from simulated clouds and star clusters.},
