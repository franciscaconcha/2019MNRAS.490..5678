\subsection{Initial conditions}
We run X simulations with N stars each located in Plummer (King?) spheres of Z size. We run M simulations lasting for 10 million years each. 

We then plot the cumulative distributions of the protoplanetary disks. To calculate the size of the protoplanetary disks we take the mass inside a characteristic radius. We set this radius to 95\% to make it similar to observations (check reference on my previous paper).
