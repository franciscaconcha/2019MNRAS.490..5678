Below is a list of the disk parameters in the simulation and their description.
Parameters related to the stellar evolution code are not relevant to the simulation and not in this list.



Parameter name                  Description
======================================================================================

stellar_mass                    Mass of the star.
bright                          True for bright stars (m > 1.9 MSun) , False for small stars (m <= 1.9 MSun)
initial_disk_size               Initial radius of the circumstellar disk.
initial_disk_mass               Initial mass of the circumstellar disk.
code                            True for stars with a running vader code, False for stars with no code
collisional_radius              Collisional radius for dynamical encounters. Equivalent to 'radius' in gravity code.
encounters                      Counter for dynamical encounters.
disk_mass                       Mass of the circumstellar disk (= 0.0 for bright stars).
disk_radius                     Radius of the circumstellar disk (= 0.0 for bright stars).
photoevap_mass_loss             Cumulative mass lost due to photoevaporation over time.
truncation_mass_loss            Cumulative mass lost due to dynamical encounters over time.
disk_size_np                    Radius of the circumstellar disk as if affected only by encounters, no photoevaporation.
disk_mass_np                    Mass of the circumstellar disk as if affected only by encounters, no photoevaporation.
dispersed                       True if disk has been dispersed, False if not. Initially False for all stars.
dispersed_disk_mass             99% of the initial disk mass. Used as a threshold for disk dispersion.
disk_density_threshold          Lower density limit used as a disk dispersion limit.
dispersal_time                  Time when the circumstellar disk was dispersed. Initially = 0 for all stars.
x                               x axis position of star.
y                               y axis position of star.
z                               z axis position of star.
vx                              x axis velocity of star.
vy                              y axis velocity of star.
vz                              z axis velocity of star.
