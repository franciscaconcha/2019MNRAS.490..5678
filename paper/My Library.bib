  abstract = {The Disk Detective citizen science project aims to find new stars with excess 22-$\mu$m emission from circumstellar dust in the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We evaluated 261 Disk Detective objects of interest with imaging with the Robo-AO adaptive optics instrument on the 1.5m telescope at Palomar Observatory and with RetroCam on the 2.5m du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to search for background objects at 0.15''-12'' separations from each target. Our analysis of these data lead us to reject 7% of targets. Combining this result with statistics from our online image classification efforts implies that at most $7.9\% \pm 0.2\%$ of AllWISE-selected infrared excesses are good disk candidates. Applying our false positive rates to other surveys, we find that the infrared excess searches of McDonald et al. (2012), McDonald et al. (2017), and Marton et al. (2016) all have false positive rates $>70\%$. Moreover, we find that all thirteen disk candidates in Theissen & West (2014) with W4 signal-to-noise >3 are false positives. We present 244 disk candidates that have survived vetting by follow-up imaging. Of these, 213 are newly-identified disk systems. Twelve of these are candidate members of comoving pairs based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, supporting the hypothesis that warm dust is associated with binary systems. We also note the discovery of 22 $\mu$m excess around two known members of the Scorpius-Centaurus association, and identify known disk host WISEA J164540.79-310226.6 as a likely Sco-Cen member. Thirty-one of these disk candidates are closer than $\sim 125$ pc (including 27 debris disks), making them good targets for direct imaging exoplanet searches.},

  doi = {10.1086/345807},
  abstract = {Far-ultraviolet (FUV, 6 eV < h  < 13:6 eV) radiation has been suggested as the main source of heating of the neutral interstellar gas, and, in this case, it determines whether the thermal balance of the neutral gas results in cold (T $ 50 100 K) clouds (cold neutral material [CNM]), warm (T $ 104 K) clouds (warm neutral material [WNM]), or a combination of the two. For gas at ﬁxed mean density, high FUV ﬁelds convert the neutral gas to WNM, while low ﬁelds result in CNM. The main sources of interstellar FUV radiation are short-lived massive stars in associations that form in giant molecular clouds. Using McKee & Williams’ distribution of birthrates for OB associations in the Galaxy, we determine the expected behavior of the timedependent FUV ﬁeld for random positions in the ISM at the solar circle. The FUV ﬁeld is calculated in two bands (912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ ) and at the wavelength 1400 A˚ . In terms of UÀ17   U= ð10À17 ergs cmÀ3 GÀ1Þ, where U is the energy density of the radiation ﬁeld in some band, we ﬁnd (mean, median) values at the solar circle of UÀ17 ¼ ð15:7; 7:4Þ and (14.2, 7.2) for the 912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ bands, respectively. At 1400 A˚ we ﬁnd (mean, median) values of UÀ17 ¼ ð14:4; 7:5Þ. Our median value for the 912–2070 A˚ band is G0 ¼ 1:6 times Habing’s value for the radiation ﬁeld at the solar circle in this band and quite close to Draine’s value, G0 ¼ 1:7. Habing and Draine’s values are based on observations of sources of FUV radiation in the solar neighborhood, so all three values are close to observed values. Because of attenuation by dust, only associations within about 500 pc contribute signiﬁcantly to the energy density at a given point. Large-angle scattering produces a diﬀuse ﬁeld that is about 10% of the ﬁeld produced by the sum of direct and small-angle (<5 ) scattering from discrete sources (the associations), as observed. At a point exposed to the median radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association typically produces about 20% of the total energy density. At a point exposed to an above average radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association produces most of the energy density. Therefore, the FUV ﬁeld is asymmetric at a given point, and the asymmetry grows for higher ﬁelds. The FUV ﬁeld ﬂuctuates with a variety of amplitudes, the larger ones being less frequent. The mean ﬁeld is about twice the median ﬁeld because of these ﬂuctuations, or spikes, in the radiation ﬁeld. These spikes, which last $30 Myr, are caused by the infrequent birth of nearby associations. For spikes that are signiﬁcantly higher than the mean ﬁeld, the time interval between spikes is $2UÀ3=125 Gyr. We also model shorter duration spikes caused by runaway OB stars. The presence of a ﬂuctuating heating rate created by the ﬂuctuating FUV ﬁeld converts CNM to WNM and vice versa.},

  abstract = {We present an extended ultraviolet-blue (850–4700 8) library of theoretical stellar spectral energy distributions computed at high resolution, k/Ák ¼ 50;000. The UVBLUE grid, as we named the library, is based on LTE calculations carried out with ATLAS9 and SYNTHE codes developed by R. L. Kurucz and consists of nearly 1800 entries that cover a large volume of the parameter space. It spans a range in TeA from 3000 to 50,000 K, the surface gravity ranges from log g ¼ 0:0 to 5.0 with Álog g ¼ 0:5 dex, while seven chemical compositions are considered: ½M/H ¼ À2:0; À1:5; À1:0; À0:5; þ0:0; þ0:3, and +0.5 dex. For its coverage across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, this library is the most comprehensive one ever computed at high resolution in the short-wavelength spectral range, and useful application can be foreseen for both the study of single stars and in population synthesis models of galaxies and other stellar systems. We brieﬂy discuss some relevant issues for a safe application of the theoretical output to ultraviolet observations, and a comparison of our LTE models with the non-LTE (NLTE) ones from the TLUSTY code is also carried out. NLTE spectra are found, on average, to be slightly ‘‘redder’’ compared to the LTE ones for the same value of TeA, while a larger difference could be detected for weak lines, which are nearly wiped out by the enhanced core emission component in case of NLTE atmospheres. These effects seem to be magniﬁed at low metallicity (typically [M/H] PÀ1). A match with a working sample of 111 stars from the IUE atlas, with available atmosphere parameters from the literature, shows that UVBLUE models provide an accurate description of the main mid- and low-resolution spectral features for stars along the whole sequence from the B to $G5 type. The comparison sensibly degrades for later spectral types, with supergiant stars that are in general more poorly reproduced than dwarfs. As a possible explanation of this overall trend, we partly invoke the uncertainty in the input atmosphere parameters to compute the theoretical spectra. In addition, one should also consider the important contamination of the IUE stellar sample, where the presence of binary and variable stars certainly works in the sense of artiﬁcially worsening the match between theory and observations.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Ophiuchus DIsc Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA), a project aiming to study the entire population of Spitzer-selected protoplanetary discs in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud (~300 objects) from both millimeter continuum and CO isotopologues data. Here we present 1.3 mm/230 GHz continuum images of 147 targets at 0.2" (28 au) resolution and a typical rms of 0.15 mJy. We detect a total of 133 discs, including the individual components of 11 binary systems and 1 triple system. Fifty-three of these discs are spatially resolved. We find clear substructures (inner cavities, rings, gaps, and/or spiral arms) in 8 of the sources and hints of such structures in another 4 discs. We construct the disc luminosity function for our targets and perform comparisons to other regions. A simple conversion between flux and dust mass (adopting standard assumptions) indicates that all discs detected at 1.3 mm are massive enough to form one or more rocky planets. In contrast, only ~50 discs (~1/3 of the sample) have enough mass in the form of dust to form the canonical 10 M_Earth core needed to trigger runaway gas accretion and the formation of gas giant planets, although the total mass of solids already incorporated into bodies larger than cm scales is mostly unconstrained. The distribution in continuum disc sizes in our sample is heavily weighted towards compact discs: most detected discs have radii < 15 au, while only 23 discs (~15% of the targets) have radii > 30 au.},

  abstract = {We present high resolution millimeter continuum imaging of the disc surrounding the young star CI Tau, a system hosting the first hot Jupiter candidate in a protoplanetary disc system. The system has extended mm emission on which are superposed three prominent annular gaps at radii ~ 13, 39 and 100 au. We argue that these gaps are most likely to be generated by massive planets so that, including the hot Jupiter, the system contains four gas giant planets at an age of only 2 Myr. Two of the new planets are similarly located to those inferred in the famous HL Tau protoplanetary disc; in CI Tau, additional observational data enables a more complete analysis of the system properties than was possible for HL Tau. Our dust and gas dynamical modeling satisfies every available observational constraint and points to the most massive ensemble of exo-planets ever detected at this age, with its four planets spanning a factor 1000 in orbital radius.Our results show that the association between hot Jupiters and gas giants on wider orbits, observed in older stars, is apparently in place at an early evolutionary stage.},

  abstract = {We present an open access grid of 3930 calculations of externally evaporating protoplanetary discs. This spans a range of disc sizes (1-400 au), disc masses, UV field strengths (10-10<SUP>4</SUP> G<SUB>0</SUB>), and stellar masses (0.05-1.9 M<SUB>☉</SUB>). The grid is publicly available for download, and offers a means of cheaply including external photoevaporation in disc evolutionary calculations. It can also be queried using an online tool for quick estimates of instantaneous mass-loss rates (e.g for convenient evaluation of real observed systems). The ``FRIED'' grid itself illustrates that for discs around stars ≤0.3 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, external photoevaporation is effective down to small radii (&lt;50 au) down to UV fields at least as weak as 10 G<SUB>0</SUB>. At the other end of the scale, in a 10<SUP>4</SUP> G<SUB>0</SUB> environment photoevaporation is effective down to 1 au even for stellar masses at least as high as 1.9 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. We also illustrate in which regimes CO survives in the photoevaporative outflow for significant mass-loss rates; marking a system a good candidate to detect external photoevaporation in weak-intermediate UV environments through sub-Keplerian rotation. Finally, we make illustrative mass-loss rate estimates for discs in Taurus based on the Guilloteau et al. (2011) star-disc parameters, finding that around half are expected to have both significant mass-loss and retain CO in the photoevaporative outflow.},

In this paper, we perform the first full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the flow from the outer rim of protoplanetary discs externally irradiated by such intermediate strength FUV fields, including direct modelling of the photon-dominated region which is required to accurately compute the thermal properties. We find excellent agreement between our models and the semi-analytic models of Facchini et al. (2016) for the profile of the flow itself, as well as the mass-loss rate and location of their `critical radius'. This both validates their results (which differed significantly from prior semi-analytic estimates) and our new numerical method, the latter of which can now be applied to elements of the problem that the semi-analytic approaches are incapable of modelling. We also obtain the composition of the flow, but given the simple geometry of our models we can only hint at some diagnostics for future observations of externally irradiated discs at this stage. We also discuss the potential for these models as benchmarks for future photochemical-dynamical codes.},

  doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/774/1/9},
  abstract = {This paper explores the effects of FUV radiation fields from external stars on circumstellar disk evolution. Disks residing in young clusters can be exposed to extreme levels of FUV flux from nearby OB stars, and observations show that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated. Typical FUV flux levels can be factors of ~10<SUP>2</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> higher than the interstellar value. These fields are effective in driving mass loss from circumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the host star, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitational potential well is shallow. We combine viscous evolution (an α-disk model) with an existing FUV photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disk lifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, including mass-loss rates, disk masses, and radii. We also consider the effects of X-ray photoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that for disks around solar-mass stars, externally generated FUV fields are often the dominant mechanism in depleting disk material. For sufficiently large viscosities, FUV fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entire range of parameter space. Disks with viscosity parameter α = 10<SUP>-3</SUP> are effectively dispersed within 1-3 Myr for higher viscosities (α = 10<SUP>-2</SUP>) disks are dispersed within ~0.25-0.5 Myr. Furthermore, disk radii are truncated to less than ~100 AU, which can possibly affect the formation of planets. Our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed masses and radii of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster.},

  doi = {10.1093/mnras/sty168},
  abstract = {We study the evolution of protoplanetary discs that would have been precursors of a Trappist-1-like system under the action of accretion and external photoevaporation in different radiation environments. Dust grains swiftly grow above the critical size below which they are entrained in the photoevaporative wind, so although gas is continually depleted, dust is resilient to photoevaporation after only a short time. This means that the ratio of the mass in solids (dust plus planetary) to the mass in gas rises steadily over time. Dust is still stripped early on, and the initial disc mass required to produce the observed 4 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> of Trappist-1 planets is high. For example, assuming a Fatuzzo &amp; Adams distribution of UV fields, typical initial disc masses have to be &gt;30 per cent the stellar (which are still Toomre Q stable) for the majority of similar mass M dwarfs to be viable hosts of the Trappist-1 planets. Even in the case of the lowest UV environments observed, there is a strong loss of dust due to photoevaporation at early times from the weakly bound outer regions of the disc. This minimum level of dust loss is a factor of 2 higher than that which would be lost by accretion on to the star during 10 Myr of evolution. Consequently, even in these least irradiated environments, discs that are viable Trappist-1 precursors need to be initially massive (&gt;10 per cent of the stellar mass).},

  abstract = {We present models in which the photoevaporation of discs around young stars by an external ultraviolet source (as computed by Adams et al.) is coupled with the internal viscous evolution of the discs. These models are applied to the case of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), where the presence of a strong ultraviolet field from the central OB stars, together with a detailed census of circumstellar discs and photoevaporative flows, is well established. In particular we investigate the constraints that are placed on the initial disc properties in the ONC by the twin requirement that most stars possess a disc on a scale of a few astronomical unit (au), but that only a minority (&lt;20 per cent) are resolved by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at a scale of 50au. We find that these requirements place very weak constraints on the initial radius distribution of circumstellar discs: the resulting size distribution readily forgets the initial radius distribution, owing to the strong positive dependence of the photoevaporation rate on disc radius. Instead, the scarcity of large discs reflects the relative scarcity of initially massive discs (with mass &gt;0.1M<SUB>solar</SUB>). The ubiquity of discs on a small scale, on the other hand, mainly constrains the time-span over which the discs have been exposed to the ultraviolet field (&lt;2Myr). We argue that the discs that are resolved by HST represent a population of discs in which self-gravity was important at the time that the dominant central OB star switched on, but that, according to our models, self-gravity is unlikely to be important in these discs at the present time. We discuss the implications of our results for the so-called proplyd lifetime problem.},

  title = {Why do protoplanetary disks appear not massive enough to form the known exoplanet population?},
  abstract = {When and how planets form in protoplanetary disks is still a topic of discussion. Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now providing results that allow us to have new insights. We collect the masses of confirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence with stellar mass with the same dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in ~1-3 Myr old star-forming regions. The latter are recalculated by us using the new estimates of their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and multiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing to a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low mass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower than the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses are comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found also by converting the measured planet masses into heavy-element content (core masses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and by comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are heavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient recycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This implies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly (<0.1-1 Myr) and large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or that disks are continuously replenished of fresh planet-forming material from the environment. These hypotheses can be tested by measuring disk masses in even younger targets and by better understanding if and how the disks are replenished by their surroundings.},

  abstract = {Lifetimes of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are believed to be severely constrained by material depleting mechanisms, including photoevaporative winds due to the host star radiation or external radiation sources. Most previous studies focused on exploring the role of the winds in the exposed PPDs with a single star; however, exploring the evolution of the circumbinary disks with the photoevaporative winds driven by the host star radiation and external radiation sources deserves further investigation. In this study, we investigate the evolution of the circumbinary PPDs with the photoevaporative winds induced by external far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field. We show that this mass-loss process can significantly constrain properties of a circumbinary PPD, including its lifetime, mass and radius. The lifetime of a circumbinary PPD, for instance, is found by a factor of about two longer than a similar circumstellar disk and this enhancement strongly depends on the viscosity parameter. But our model shows that viscosity dependence of the disk lifetime in the circumbinary case is more pronounced compared to the circumstellar case. We also show that dispersal of a circumbinary PPD occurs over a longer time as the disk temperature distribution becomes steeper. Our results also imply that dead zone in a photoevaporative circumbinary PPD extends over a larger radial range in comparison to a circumstellar disk counterpart. We also show that our calculations are in agreement with the observed circumbinary PPDs orbiting equal-mass binaries.},

Longer wavelength observations are essential to properly disentangle these effects. The high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will open up the possibilities to spatially resolve disk continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths and beyond, which allows the study of dust growth in disks in the optically thin regime and further constrain models of planet formation.},

Observationally, Massey ﬁnds such a deﬁcit in samples of the ﬁeld population in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, with an initial mass function (IMF) slope of ΓIMF ∼ 4. These IMF measurements represent some of the largest known deviations from the standard Salpeter IMF slope of ΓIMF = 1.35. Here, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the mass function above 20 M for the entire ﬁeld population of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on data from the Runaways and Isolated O Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4). This is a spatially complete census of the entire ﬁeld OB star population of the SMC obtained with the IMACS multi-object spectrograph and MIKE echelle spectrograph on the Magellan telescopes. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of the evolved present-day mass function, we ﬁnd the slope of the ﬁeld IMF above 20 M is ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.4. We extend our IMF measurement to lower masses using BV photometry from the OGLE II survey. We use a statistical approach to generate a probability distribution for the mass of each star from the OGLE photometry, and we again ﬁnd ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.6 for stellar masses from 7 M to 20 M . The discovery and removal of ten runaways in our RIOTS4 sample steepens the ﬁeld IMF slope to ΓIMF = 2.8 ± 0.5. We discuss the possible effects of binarity and star formation history on our results, and conclude that the steep ﬁeld massive star IMF is most likely a real effect.},

  doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/804/1/29},
  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are dispersed by viscous evolution and photoevaporation in a few million years; in the interim small, sub-micron-sized dust grains must grow and form planets. The time-varying abundance of small grains in an evolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons, while dust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and resulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in turn, selectively carry small dust grains, leaving the larger particles—which decouple, from the gas—behind in the disk. We study these effects by investigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by EUV, FUV, and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a one-dimensional (1D) multi-fluid approach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface density distributions. The 1D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models constructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and determine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust coagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk lifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is thus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find that photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass ratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result in a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen. We discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet formation, including the formation of gas-poor giants. After gas disk dispersal, ̃ 3× {{10}<SUP>-4</SUP>} M <SUB>☉ </SUB> of mass in solids typically remain, comparable to the solids inventory of our solar system.},

Viscous accretion depletes significant amounts of the mass in gas and solids, while photoevaporative flows driven by internal and external irradiation remove most of the gas. A reasonably large fraction of the mass in solids and some gas get incorporated into planets.

  title = {Photoevaporation of Circumstellar Disks Due to External Far-Ultraviolet Radiation in Stellar Aggregates},
  volume = {611},
  doi = {10.1086/421989},
  abstract = {When stars form within small groups (with N<SUB>*</SUB>~100-500 members), their circumstellar disks are exposed to relatively little extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; hν&gt;13.6 eV) radiation but a great deal of far-ultraviolet (FUV; 6eV&lt;hν&lt;13.6eV) radiation (~10<SUP>3</SUP> times the local interstellar FUV field) from the most massive stars in the group. This paper calculates the mass-loss rates and evaporation timescales for circumstellar disks exposed to external FUV radiation. Previous work treated large disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius r<SUB>d</SUB> exceeds the critical radius r<SUB>g</SUB> where the sound speed in the FUV heated surface layer exceeds the escape speed; it has often been assumed that photoevaporation occurs for r<SUB>d</SUB>&gt;r<SUB>g</SUB> and is negligible for r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;r<SUB>g</SUB>. Since r<SUB>g</SUB>&gt;~100 AU for FUV heating, this would imply little mass loss from the planet-forming regions of a disk. In this paper we focus on systems in which photoevaporation is suppressed because r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;r<SUB>g</SUB> and show that significant mass loss still takes place as long as r<SUB>d</SUB>/r<SUB>g</SUB>&gt;~0.1-0.2. Some of the gas extends beyond the disk edge (or above the disk surface) to larger distances where the temperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. The resulting evaporation rate is a sensitive function of the central stellar mass and disk radius, which determine the escape speed, and the external FUV flux, which determines the temperature structure of the surface layers and outflowing gas. Disks around red dwarfs, low-mass stars with M<SUB>*</SUB>&lt;~0.5 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, are evaporated and shrink to disk radii r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;~15 AU on short timescales t&lt;~10 Myr when exposed to moderate FUV fields with G<SUB>0</SUB>=3000 (where G<SUB>0</SUB>=1.7 for the local interstellar FUV field). The disks around solar-type stars are more durable. For intense FUV radiation fields with G<SUB>0</SUB>=30,000, however, even these disks shrink to r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;~15 AU on timescales t~10 Myr. Such fields exist within about 0.7 pc of the center of a cluster with N<SUB>*</SUB>~4000 stars. If our solar system formed in the presence of such strong FUV radiation fields, this mechanism could explain why Neptune and Uranus in our solar system are gas-poor, whereas Jupiter and Saturn are relatively gas-rich. This mechanism for photoevaporation can also limit the production of Kuiper Belt objects and can suppress giant planet formation in sufficiently large clusters, such as the Hyades, especially for disks associated with low-mass stars.},

  title = {IN-SYNC. VIII. Primordial Disk Frequencies in NGC 1333, IC 348, and the Orion A Molecular Cloud},
  abstract = {In this paper, we address two issues related to primordial disk evolution in three clusters (NGC 1333, IC 348, and Orion A) observed by the INfrared Spectra of Young Nebulous Clusters (IN-SYNC) project. First, in each cluster, averaged over the spread of age, we investigate how disk lifetime is dependent on stellar mass. The general relation in IC 348 and Orion A is that primordial disks around intermediate mass stars (2--5$M_{\odot}$) evolve faster than those around loss mass stars (0.1--1$M_{\odot}$), which is consistent with previous results. However, considering only low mass stars, we do not find a significant dependence of disk frequency on stellar mass. These results can help to better constrain theories on gas giant planet formation timescales. Secondly, in the Orion A molecular cloud, in the mass range of 0.35--0.7$M_{\odot}$, we provide the most robust evidence to date for disk evolution within a single cluster exhibiting modest age spread. By using surface gravity as an age indicator and employing 4.5 $\mu m$ excess as a primordial disk diagnostic, we observe a trend of decreasing disk frequency for older stars. The detection of intra-cluster disk evolution in NGC 1333 and IC 348 is tentative, since the slight decrease of disk frequency for older stars is a less than 1-$\sigma$ effect.},

  abstract = {We present a methodology to interpret observations of protoplanetary discs where a flyby, also called a tidal encounter, is suspected. In case of a flyby, protoplanetary discs can be significantly disturbed. The resulting dynamical and kinematical signatures can last for several thousands of years after the flyby and hence deeply affect the evolution of the disc. These effects are stronger for closer encounters and more massive perturbers. For the very same flyby parameters, varying the inclination of the perturber's orbit produces a broad range of disc structures: spirals, bridges, warps and cavities. We study this kind of features both in the gas and in the dust for grains ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 10 cm in size. Interestingly, the dust exhibits a different dynamical behaviour compared to the gas because of gas-drag effects. Finally, flybys can also trigger high accretion events in the disc-hosting star, readily similar to FU Orionis-type outbursts. All this information can be used to infer the flyby parameters from an incomplete set of observations at different wavelengths. Therefore, the main scope of our flyby scene investigation (FSI) methodology is to help to interpret recent "puzzling" disc observations.},

It is highly probable that this cluster environment influenced various properties of the solar system such as its chemical composition, size, and the orbital parameters of some of its constituting bodies. <BR /> Aims: In the Milky Way, clusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters and leaky clusters -, each following a unique temporal development in the mass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in the range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster environments as a function of cluster age. Methods.N-body methods were used to investigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions between cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. <BR /> Results: Using the now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age we demonstrate that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first 5 Myr are so high (initially &gt; 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> pc<SUP>-3</SUP>) that hardly any discs with solar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes starburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar system. Instead it is highly probable that the solar system formed in a leaky cluster (often classified as OB association). We demonstrate that an encounter determining the characteristic properties existing in our solar systems most likely happened very early on (&lt;2 Myr) in its formation history and that after 5 Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an encounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the bound remnant. This explains why the solar system could develop and maintain its high circularity later in its development.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are quasi-steady structures whose evolution and dispersal determine the environment for planet formation. I review the theory of protoplanetary disk evolution and its connection to observations. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential angular momentum transport processes—including self-gravity, magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking—and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size, and magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early stages of planet formation and may vary dramatically from star to star. The importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales between 1 AU and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain.},

(2018) suggest that such small dense subpopulations eject all their OB stars via the decay of unstable few-body systems such that the gas can recombine and form new stars. This explains the multisequence phenomenon without introducing an extra mechanism into star formation theory. In this work, we apply the recently updated primordial binary distribution model (Belloni et al. 2017; implemented here in a new version of MCLUSTER) and perform a large set of direct N-body simulations to investigate the feasibility of this dynamical scenario. Our results suggest that if 3-4 OB stars in the ONC formed primordially mass-segregated in the cluster centre with a maximum separation of about 0.003 pc, all OB stars have a high chance (50-70 per cent) to escape from the centre and do not come back within 1 Myr and the dynamical ejection scenario is a viable channel to form short-age-interval multipopulation sequences as observed in the ONC. This is also consistent with self-regulated star formation.},

  abstract = {We present a model for the evolution of a population of single stars and binaries, in which the eccentricity of initial binaries and mass transfer between the binary components are taken into account. To illustrate the model, we apply it to the formation of neutron stars, both single and in binaries. The eccentricity of primordial binaries allows a wide, non-interacting binary to survive the first and second supernovae in many more cases than suggested by previous calculations that assume circular orbits. Mass transfer in binaries enhances the rate of type I supernovae with respect to that of the type II supernovae. A sizable fraction of initial binaries merge into a single star; 10-15% of the type II supernovae are from such mergers. Models in which neutron stars receive a kick velocity at birth predict birth rates for wide and close radio-pulsar binaries, and for high-mass (including Be-) X-ray binaries that are roughly in agreement with observations. All our models produce too many Her X-1 type binaries. The formation rate of
radio-pulsars that remain in a binary after the first supernova
explosion and are released at the second supernova event is predicted by our models to be comparable to the formation rate of recycled binary radio pulsars, i.e. less than a few per cent of the formation rate of single radio pulsars.},

We investigate the potential contribution to the SNIa rate from the population of merging double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. We aim to develope a model that fits the observed SNIa progenitors as well as the observed close double white dwarf population. We differentiate between two scenarios for the common envelope (CE) evolution; the alpha-formalism based on the energy equation and the gamma-formalism that is based on the angular momentum equation. In one model we apply the alpha-formalism always. In the second model the gamma-formalism is applied, unless the binary contains a compact object or the CE is triggered by a tidal instability for which the alpha-formalism is used. The binary population synthesis code SeBa was used to evolve binary systems from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of double white dwarfs and subsequent mergers. SeBa has been thoroughly updated since the last publication of the content of the code. The limited sample of observed double white dwarfs is better represented by the simulated population using the gamma-formalism than the alpha-formalism. For both CE formalisms, we find that although the morphology of the simulated delay time distribution matches that of the observations within the errors, the normalisation and time-integrated rate per stellar mass are a factor 7-12 lower than observed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the simulated populations of merging double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are discussed and put in the context of alternative SNIa models for merging double white dwarfs.},

We carry out global full magnetohydrodynamic simulations in axisymmetry, coupled with ray-tracing radiative transfer, consistent thermochemistry, and non-ideal MHD diffusivities. Magnetized models lacking EUV photons (\$h$\backslash$nu$>$13.6$\backslash$ $\backslash$mathrm\{eV\}\$) feature warm molecular outflows that have typical poloidal speeds \$$\backslash$gtrsim 4$\backslash$ $\backslash$mathrm\{km$\backslash$ s\}\^\{-1\}\$. When the magnetization is sufficient to drive accretion rates \$$\backslash$sim 10\^\{-8\}$\backslash$ M\_$\backslash$odot$\backslash$ $\backslash$mathrm\{yr\}\^\{-1\}\$, the wind mass-loss rate is comparable. Such outflows are driven not centrifugally but by the pressure of toroidal magnetic fields produced by bending the poloidal field. Both the accretion and outflow rates increase with the poloidal field energy density, the former almost linearly. The mass-loss rate is also strongly affected by ionization due to UV and X-ray radiation near the wind base. Adding EUV irradiation to the system heats, ionizes, and accelerates the part of the outflow nearest the symmetry axis, but reduces the overall mass-loss rate by exerting pressure on the wind base. Most of our models are non-turbulent, but some with reduced dust abundance and therefore higher ionization fractions exhibit magnetorotational instabilities near the base of the wind.},

  abstract = {Context. Protoplanetary disks have been studied extensively, both physically and chemically, to understand the environment in which planets form. However, the first steps of planet formation are likely to occur already when the protostar and disk are still embedded in their natal envelope. The initial conditions for planet formation may thus be provided by these young embedded disks, of which the physical and chemical structure is poorly characterized. \\
 Aims: We aim to constrain the midplane temperature structure, one of the critical unknowns, of the embedded disk around L1527. In particular, we set out to determine whether there is an extended cold outer region where CO is frozen out, as is the case for Class II disks. This will show whether young disks are indeed warmer than their more evolved counterparts, as is predicted by physical models. \\
 Methods: We used archival ALMA data of \textsuperscript{13}CO J = 2-1, C\textsuperscript{18}O J = 2-1 and N\textsubscript{2}D\textsuperscript{+}J = 3-2 to directly observe the midplane of the near edge-on L1527 disk. The optically thick CO isotopologues allowed us to derive a radial temperature profile for the disk midplane, while N\textsubscript{2}D\textsuperscript{+}, which can only be abundant when CO is frozen out, provides an additional constraint on the temperature. Moreover, the effect of CO freeze-out on the \textsuperscript{13}CO, C\textsuperscript{18}O and N\textsubscript{2}D\textsuperscript{+} emission was investigated using 3D radiative transfer modeling. \\
 Results: Optically thick \textsuperscript{13}CO and C\textsuperscript{18}O emission is observed throughout the disk and inner envelope, while N\textsubscript{2}D\textsuperscript{+} is not detected. Both CO isotopologues have brightness temperatures $\greaterequivlnt$25 K along the midplane. Disk and envelope emission can be disentangled kinematically, because the largest velocities are reached in the disk. A power law radial temperature profile constructed using the highest midplane temperature at these velocities suggest that the temperature is above 20 K out to at least 75 au, and possibly throughout the entire 125 au disk. The radiative transfer models show that a model without CO freeze-out in the disk matches the C\textsuperscript{18}O observations better than a model with the CO snowline at 70 au. In addition, there is no evidence for a large (order of magnitude) depletion of CO. \\
 Conclusions: The disk around L1527 is likely to be warm enough to have CO present in the gas phase throughout the disk, suggesting that young embedded disks can indeed be warmer than the more evolved Class II disks.},

It has a size of \~30 au along the major axis. It is geometrically thick, indicating that the (sub)millimeter light-emitting grains have yet to settle to the midplane.

While models based on this simplified geometry provide only approximations to the true processes of instability-driven mass and angular momentum transport, their simplicity makes them invaluable tools for both semi-analytic modeling and simulations of long-term evolution where two- or three-dimensional calculations are too computationally costly. Despite the utility of these models, the only publicly-available frameworks for simulating them are rather specialized and non-general. Here we describe a highly flexible, general numerical method for simulating viscous thin disks with arbitrary rotation curves, viscosities, boundary conditions, grid spacings, equations of state, and rates of gain or loss of mass (e.g., through winds) and energy (e.g., through radiation). Our method is based on a conservative, finite-volume, second-order accurate discretization of the equations, which we solve using an unconditionally-stable implicit scheme. We implement Anderson acceleration to speed convergence of the scheme, and show that this leads to factor of $\sim$5 speed gains over non-accelerated methods in realistic problems, though the amount of speedup is highly problem-dependent. We have implemented our method in the new code Viscous Accretion Disk Evolution Resource (VADER), which is freely available for download from https://bitbucket.org/krumholz/vader/ under the terms of the GNU General Public License.},

  shorttitle = {The {{ALMA Lupus}} Protoplanetary Disk Survey},
  abstract = {The cyanide radical CN is abundant in protoplanetary disks, with line fluxes often comparable to those of \$\^\{13\}\$CO. It is known to be sensitive to UV irradiation of the upper disk atmosphere, with models predicting ring-shaped emission. We seek to characterize the CN emission from 94 Class II disks in the Lupus star forming region, compare it to observations in other regions, and interpret our observations with a grid of models. The CN emission morphology is discussed for two primordial disks, Sz 71 and Sz 98, and modeled in more detail. ALMA observed CN N=3-2 in Lupus disks down to sensitivities better than previous surveys. Models constructed with the physico-chemical code DALI are used to study the integrated fluxes of the disks and resolved emission of CN in disks without (dust) substructures. We find that CN N=3-2 is bright, and detected in 38\% of sources, but its disk-integrated flux is not strongly correlated to either \$\^\{13\}\$CO or continuum flux. Compared to pre-ALMA single-dish surveys, no significant difference in the CN flux distributions in Lupus and Taurus-Auriga is found, although \$$\backslash$rho\$ Ophiuchus disks may be fainter on average. We find ring-shaped CN emission with peak radii of \textasciitilde{}50 AU in two resolved disks. We conclude that a large fraction of sources is faint in CN; only exponential gas surface density cutoffs at \$R\_\{c\} $\backslash$leq 15\$ AU can reconcile observations with models. This is the first observational evidence of such a compact gas disk population in Lupus. Absolute intensities and the emission morphology of CN are reproduced by DALI models without the need for any continuum substructure; they are unrelated to the CO snowline location. These observations and the successful modeling of these rings provide a new probe of the structure and conditions in disks, and particularly their incident UV radiation field, if disk size is determined by the data.},

At a distance of 819+/-16 pc, Cep OB3b is one of the closest examples of a young (\textasciitilde{}3 - 5 Myr), large (\textasciitilde{}3000 total members) cluster at the late stages of gas dispersal. The cluster is broken into two sub-clusters surrounded by a lower density halo. We fit the empirical density law of King (1962) to each sub-cluster to constrain their sizes and structure. The richer eastern sub-cluster has circular symmetry, a modest central density, and lacks molecular gas toward its core suggesting it has undergone expansion due to gas dispersal. In contrast, the western sub-cluster deviates from circular symmetry, has a smaller core size, and contains significant molecular gas near its core, suggesting that it is in an earlier phase of gas dispersal. We present posterior probability distributions for the velocity dispersions from the Hectoschelle spectra. The east will continue to expand and likely form a bound cluster with \textasciitilde{}35\% of stars remaining. The west is undergoing slower gas dispersal and will potentially form a bound cluster with \textasciitilde{}75\% of stars remaining. If the halo dissipates, this will leave two independent clusters with \textasciitilde{}300 members; proper motions suggest that the two sub-clusters are not bound to each other.},

  shorttitle = {The {{AMBRE Project}}},
  abstract = {Finding solar siblings, that is, stars that formed in the same cluster as the Sun, will yield information about the conditions at the Sun's birthplace. We search for solar sibling candidates in AMBRE, the very large spectra database of solar vicinity stars. Since the ages and chemical abundances of solar siblings are very similar to those of the Sun, we carried out a chemistry- and age-based search for solar sibling candidates. We used high-resolution spectra to derive precise stellar parameters and chemical abundances of the stars. We used these spectroscopic parameters together with Gaia DR2 astrometric data to derive stellar isochronal ages. Gaia data were also used to study the kinematics of the sibling candidates. From the about 17000 stars that are characterized within the AMBRE project, we first selected 55 stars whose metallicities are closest to the solar value (-0.1 \&lt; [Fe/H] \&lt; 0.1 dex). For these stars we derived precise chemical abundances of several iron-peak, alpha- and neutron-capture elements, based on which we selected 12 solar sibling candidates with average abundances and metallicities between -0.03 to 0.03 dex. Our further selection left us with 4 candidates with stellar ages that are compatible with the solar age within observational uncertainties. For the 2 of the hottest candidates, we derived the carbon isotopic ratios, which are compatible with the solar value. HD186302 is the most precisely characterized and probably the most probable candidate of our 4 best candidates. Very precise chemical characterization and age estimation is necessary to identify solar siblings. We propose that in addition to typical chemical tagging, the study of isotopic ratios can give further important information about the relation of sibling candidates with the Sun. Ideally, asteroseismic age determinations of the candidates could solve the problem of imprecise isochronal ages.},

  volume = {457},
  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stw006},
  abstract = {We use self-consistent numerical simulations of the evolution and disruption of the Sun's birth cluster in the Milky Way potential to investigate the present-day phase-space distribution of the Sun's siblings. The simulations include the gravitational N-body forces within the cluster and the effects of stellar evolution on the cluster population. In addition, the gravitational forces due to the Milky Way potential are accounted for in a self-consistent manner. Our aim is to understand how the astrometric and radial velocity data from the Gaia mission can be used to pre-select solar sibling candidates. We vary the initial conditions of the Sun's birth cluster, as well as the parameters of the Galactic potential. In particular, we use different configurations and strengths of the bar and spiral arms. We show that the disruption time-scales of the cluster are insensitive to the details of the non-axisymmetric components of the Milky Way model and we make predictions, averaged over the different simulated possibilities, about the number of solar siblings that should appear in surveys such as Gaia or GALAH. We find a large variety of present-day phase-space distributions of solar siblings, which depend on the cluster initial conditions and the Milky Way model parameters. We show that nevertheless robust predictions can be made about the location of the solar siblings in the space of parallaxes ($\varpi$), proper motions ($\mu$) and radial velocities (V\textsubscript{r}). By calculating the ratio of the number of simulated solar siblings to that of the number of stars in a model Galactic disc, we find that this ratio is above 0.5 in the region given by: $\varpi$ $\geq$ 5 mas, 4 $\leq$ $\mu$ $\leq$ 6 mas yr\textsuperscript{-1}, and -2 $\leq$ V\textsubscript{r} $\leq$ 0 km s\textsuperscript{-1}. Selecting stars from this region should increase the probability of success in identifying solar siblings through follow-up observations. However the proposed pre-selection criterion is sensitive to our assumptions, in particular about the Galactic potential. Using a more realistic potential (e.g. including transient spiral structure and molecular clouds) would make the pre-selection of solar sibling candidates based on astrometric and radial velocity data very inefficient. This reinforces the need for large-scale surveys to determine precise astrophysical properties of stars, in particular their ages and chemical abundances, if we want to identify the solar family.},

  abstract = {The discovery of 2012 VP\textsubscript{113} initiated the debate on the origin of the Sedna family of planetesimals in orbit around the Sun. Sednitos roam the outer regions of the Solar system between the Egeworth-Kuiper belt and the Oort Cloud, in extraordinary wide (a \&gt; 150 au) orbits with a large perihelion distance of q \&gt; 30 au compared to the Earth's (a $\equiv$ 1 au and eccentricity e $\equiv$ (1 - q/a) $\simeq$ 0.0167 or q $\simeq$ 1 au). This population is composed of a dozen objects, which we consider a family because they have similar perihelion distance and inclination with respect to the ecliptic i = 10$^\circ$-30$^\circ$. They also have similar argument of perihelion $\omega$ = 340$^\circ$ $\pm$ 55$^\circ$. There is no ready explanation for their origin. Here we show that these orbital parameters are typical for a captured population from the planetesimal disc of another star. Assuming that the orbital elements of Sednitos have not changed since they acquired their orbits, we reconstruct the encounter that led to their capture. We conclude that they might have been captured in a near miss with a 1.8 M\textsubscript{$\Sun$} star that impacted the Sun at $\simeq$ 340 au at an inclination with respect to the ecliptic of 17$^\circ$-34$^\circ$ with a relative velocity at infinity of \~4.3 km s\textsuperscript{-1}. We predict that the Sednitos region is populated by 930 planetesimals and the inner Oort Cloud acquired \~440 planetesimals through the same encounter.},

  abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of protoplanetary disks ("proplyds") in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We imaged five individual fields at 856 $\mu$m containing 22 Hubble Space Telescope ( HST )-identified proplyds and detected 21 of them. Eight of those disks were detected for the first time at submillimeter wavelengths, including the most prominent, well-known proplyd in the entire Orion Nebula, 114-426. Thermal dust emission in excess of any free-free component was measured in all but one of the detected disks, and ranged between 1 and 163 mJy, with resulting disk masses of 0.3-79 M jup . An additional 26 stars with no prior evidence of associated disks in HST observations were also imaged within the 5 fields, but only 2 were detected. The disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which include OB stars, \texttheta{} 1 Ori C, and \texttheta{} 1 Ori F, range from 0.1 to0.6 M jup . Combining these ALMA data with previous Submillimeter Array observations, we find a lack of massive ( \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] gsim3 M jup ) disks in the extreme-UV-dominated region of Orion, within 0.03 pc of \texttheta{} 1 Ori C. At larger separations from \texttheta{} 1 Ori C, in the far-UV-dominated region, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found in low-mass star forming regions. Taken together, these results suggest that a rapid dissipation of disk masses likely inhibits potential planet formation in the extreme-UV-dominated regions of OB associations, but leaves disks in the far-UV-dominated regions relatively unaffected.},

  volume = {539},
  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201015914},
  abstract = {Context. Circumstellar disks are expected to evolve quickly in massive young clusters harboring many OB-type stars. Two processes have been proposed to drive the disk evolution in such cruel environments: (1) gravitational interaction between circumstellar disks and nearby passing stars (stellar encounters); and (2) photoevaporation by UV photons from massive stars. The relative importance of both mechanisms is not well understood. Studies of massive young star clusters can provide observational constraints on the processes of driving disk evolution. \\
 Aims: We investigate the properties of young stars and their disks in the NGC 6357 complex, concentrating on the most massive star cluster within the complex: Pismis 24. \\
 Methods: We use infrared data from the 2MASS and Spitzer GLIMPSE surveys, complemented with our own deep Spitzer imaging of the central regions of Pismis 24, in combination with X-ray data to search for young stellar objects (YSOs) in NGC 6357 complex. The infrared data constrain the disk presence and are complemented by optical photometric and spectroscopic observations, obtained with VLT/VIMOS, that constrain the properties of the central stars. For those stars with reliable spectral types we combine spectra and photometry to estimate the mass and age. For cluster members without reliable spectral types we obtain the mass and age probability distributions from R and I-band photometry, assuming these stars have the same extinction distribution as those in the "spectroscopic" sample. We compare the disk properties in the Pismis 24 cluster with those in other clusters/star-forming regions employing infrared color-color diagrams. \\
 Results: We discover two new young clusters in the NGC 6357 complex. We give a revised distance estimate for Pismis 24 of 1.7 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc. We find that the massive star Pis 24-18 is a binary system, with the secondary being the main X-ray source of the pair. We provide photometry in 9 bands between 0.55 and 9 $\mu$m for the members of the Pismis 24 cluster. We derive the cluster mass function and find that up to the completeness limit at low masses it agrees well with the initial mass function of the Trapezium cluster. We derive a median age of 1 Myr for the Pismis 24 cluster members. We find five proplyds in HST archival imaging of the cluster, four of which are newly found. In all cases the proplyd tails are pointing directly away from the massive star system Pis 24-1. One proplyd shows a second tail, pointing away from Pis 24-2, suggesting this object is being photoevaporated from two directions simultaneously. We find that the global disk frequency (\textasciitilde{}30\%) in Pismis 24 is much lower than some other clusters of similar age, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. When comparing the disk frequencies in 19 clusters/star-forming regions of various ages and different (massive) star content, we find that the disks in clusters harboring extremely massive stars (typically earlier than O5), like Pismis 24, are dissipated roughly twice as quickly as in clusters/star-forming regions without extremely massive stars. Within Pismis 24, we find that the disk frequency within a projected distance of 0.6 pc from Pis 24-1 is substantially lower than at larger radii (\textasciitilde{}19\% vs. \textasciitilde{}37\%). We argue for a combination of photoevaporation and irradiation with ionizing UV photons from nearby massive stars, causing increased MRI-induced turbulence and associated accretion activity, to play an important role in the dissipation of low-mass star disks in Pismis 24.

We combine catalogues of resolved protoplanetary discs (PPDs) and young stellar objects in the solar neighbourhood to analyse the PPD size distribution as a function of ambient stellar density. By running Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests between the PPD radii at different densities, we find empirical evidence, at the $>$97\% confidence level, for a change in the PPD radius distribution at ambient stellar densities $\Sigma$ $\greaterequivlnt$ 103.5
pc-2. This coincides with a simple theoretical estimate for the truncation of PPDs or planetary systems by dynamical encounters. If this agreement is causal, the ongoing disruption of PPDs and planetary systems limits the possible existence of planets in the habitable zone, with shorter lifetimes at higher host stellar masses and ambient densities. Therefore, habitable planets are not likely to be present in long-lived stellar clusters, and may have been ejected altogether to form a population of unbound, free-floating planets. We conclude that, while highly suggestive, our results should be verified through other methods. Our simple model shows that truncations should lead to a measurable depletion of the PPD mass function that can be detected with ALMA observations of the densest nearby and young clusters.

  abstract = {It has recently been noted that many discs around T Tauri stars appear to comprise only a few Jupiter masses of gas and dust. Using millimetre surveys of discs within six local star formation regions, we confirm this result, and find that only a few per cent of young stars have enough circumstellar material to build gas giant planets, in standard core accretion models. Since the frequency of observed exoplanets is greater than this, there is a ‘missing-mass' problem. As alternatives to simply adjusting the conversion of dust flux to disc mass, we investigate three other classes of solution. Migration of planets could hypothetically sweep up the disc mass reservoir more efficiently, but trends in multiplanet systems do not support such a model, and theoretical models suggest that the gas accretion time-scale is too short for migration to sweep the disc. Enhanced inner-disc mass reservoirs are possible, agreeing with predictions of disc evolution through self-gravity, but not adding to millimetre dust flux as the inner disc is optically thick. Finally, the incidence of massive discs is shown to be higher at the protostellar stages, Classes 0 and I, where discs substantial enough to form planets via core accretion are abundant enough to match the frequency of exoplanets. Gravitational instability may also operate in the Class 0 epoch, where half the objects have potentially unstable discs of \&gt;\textasciitilde{}30 per cent of the stellar mass. However, recent calculations indicate that forming gas giants inside 50 au by instability is unlikely, even in such massive discs. Overall, the results presented suggest that the canonically ‘protoplanetary' discs of Class II T Tauri stars have globally low masses in dust observable at millimetre wavelengths, and conversion to larger bodies (anywhere from small rocks up to planetary cores) must already have occurred.},

  abstract = {We study the hydrodynamic evolution of protostellar disks under the influence of a central source of ionizing radiation and its stellar wind. Here we examine the effects of an important contribution to the diffuse radiation field - the scattering of hydrogen-ionizing photons on dust grains (dust scattering). We present and discuss the resulting changes in the evolution of the system under a variety of conditions both with and without dust scattering. An important consequence is the significant increase in the photoevaporation rate. Depending on the scattering coefficient assumed, the presence of dust within the ionized region can increase the density and flow of ionized material and correspondingly shorten the disk's lifetime by a factor of two or more. In addition, the temperature of the ionized outflowing gas is slightly higher and remains more nearly constant over the extent of the ionized region, even in the regions shadowed from direct stellar radiation. We also investigate the influence of other major parameters of the problem, wind velocity, wind mass loss rate, and stellar ionizing flux, by systematically varying these parameters. Over a large range of values of stellar ionizing flux S\_star\_ we find a power law dependence of the disk mass loss rate due to photoionization \.(M)\_ph\_\{prop.to\}S\_star\_\^0.58\^ which is comparable to analytic estimates. Deviations from this power law occurred for moderate values S\_star\_\&gt;10\^47\^s\^-1\^ due to our finite disk size and for low values S\_star\_\&lt;\textasciitilde{}10\^45\^s\^-1\^ due to the resulting non-steady flow pattern. Because we have assumed a warm (T=\textasciitilde{}10\^4\^K) wind and have included heating, cooling, ionization, and recombination processes in the stellar wind, we find that the disk's photoevaporation rate depends on the assumed wind parameters in a manner which can be explained by the loss of UV ionizing photons very close to the central star.},

We use N-body simulations to explore how their evolution depends on the system size N and the initial conditions. Motivated by recent observations suggesting that stellar groups begin their evolution with subvirial speeds, this study compares subvirial starting states with virial starting states. Multiple realizations of equivalent cases (100 simulations per initial condition) are used to build up a robust statistical description of these systems, e.g., the probability distribution of closest approaches, the mass profiles, and the probability distribution for the radial location of cluster members. These results provide a framework from which to assess the effects of groups/clusters on the processes of star and planet formation and to study cluster evolution. The distributions of radial positions are used in conjunction with the probability distributions of the expected far-ultraviolet (FUV) luminosities (calculated here as a function of cluster size N) to determine the radiation exposure of circumstellar disks. The distributions of closest approaches are used in conjunction with scattering cross sections (calculated here as a function of stellar mass using \textasciitilde{}10\textsuperscript{5} Monte Carlo scattering experiments) to determine the probability of disruption for newly formed solar systems. We use the nearby cluster NGC 1333 as a test case in this investigation. The main conclusion of this study is that clusters in this size range have only a modest effect on forming planetary systems. The interaction rates are low, so that the typical solar system experiences a single encounter with closest approach distance b\textasciitilde{}1000 AU. The radiation exposure is also low, with median FUV flux G\textsubscript{0}\textasciitilde{}900 (1.4 ergs s\textsuperscript{-1} cm\textsuperscript{-2}), so that photoevaporation of circumstellar disks is only important beyond 30 AU. Given the low interaction rates and modest radiation levels, we suggest that solar system disruption is a rare event in these clusters.},

  abstract = {Context. Rotationally supported disks are critical in the star formation process. The questions of when they form and what factors influence or hinder their formation have been studied but are largely unanswered. Observations of early-stage YSOs are needed to probe disk formation. \\
 Aims: VLA1623 is a triple non-coeval protostellar system, with a weak magnetic field perpendicular to the outflow, whose Class 0 component, VLA1623A, shows a disk-like structure in continuum with signatures of rotation in line emission. We aim to determine whether this structure is in part or in whole a rotationally supported disk, i.e. a Keplerian disk, and what its characteristics are. \\
 Methods: ALMA Cycle 0 Early Science 1.3 mm continuum and C\textsuperscript{18}O (2-1) observations in the extended configuration are presented here and used to perform an analysis of the disk-like structure using position-velocity (PV) diagrams and thin disk modeling with the addition of foreground absorption. \\
 Results: The PV diagrams of the C\textsuperscript{18}O line emission suggest the presence of a rotationally supported component with a radius of at least 50 AU. Kinematical modeling of the line emission shows that the disk out to 180 AU is actually rotationally supported, with the rotation described well by Keplerian rotation out to at least 150 AU, and the central source mass is \textasciitilde{}0.2 M\textsubscript{$\Sun$} for an inclination of 55$^\circ$. Pure infall and conserved angular momentum rotation models are excluded. \\
 Conclusions: VLA1623A, a very young Class 0 source, presents a disk with an outer radius R\textsubscript{out} = 180 AU with a Keplerian velocity structure out to at least 150 AU. The weak magnetic fields and recent fragmentation in this region of $\rho$ Ophiuchus may have played a leading role in the formation of the disk.

  abstract = {HH 211-mms is one of the youngest Class 0 protostellar systems in Perseus, at a distance of \~235 pc. We have mapped its central region at up to \~7 au (0.${''}$03) resolution. A dusty disk is seen deeply embedded in a flattened envelope, with an intensity jump in the dust continuum at \~350 GHz. It is nearly edge-on and is almost exactly perpendicular to the jet axis. It has a size of \~30 au along the major axis. It is geometrically thick, indicating that the (sub)millimeter light-emitting grains have yet to settle to the midplane. Its inner part is expected to have transformed into a Keplerian rotating disk with a radius of \~10 au. A rotating disk atmosphere and a compact rotating bipolar outflow are detected in SO N \textsubscript{ J } = 8\textsubscript{9} - 7\textsubscript{8}. The outflow fans out from the inner disk surfaces and is rotating in the same direction as the flattened envelope, and hence could trace a disk wind carrying away angular momentum from the inner disk. From the rotation of the disk atmosphere, the protostellar mass is estimated to be $\lessequivlnt$50 M \textsubscript{Jup}. Together with results from the literature, our result favors a model where the disk radius grows linearly with the protostellar mass, as predicted by models of pre-stellar dense core evolution that asymptotes to an r \textsuperscript{-1} radial profile for both the column density and angular velocity.},

  abstract = {Disk winds are thought to play an important role in the evolution and dispersal of planet-forming disks. While high-resolution optical and infrared spectroscopy has identified several disk wind diagnostics, wind mass loss rates remain largely unconstrained mostly due to the lack of spatial resolution to measure the extent of the wind emitting region. Here, we show that the ngVLA will have the sensitivity and resolution to detect and spatially resolve the free-free emission from the fully or partially ionized component of disk winds. Hence, ngVLA observations will be critical to estimate mass loss rates and clarify the role of disk winds in the evolution and dispersal of disk mass.},

  abstract = {Based on the interstellar CO/H2 ratio, carbon monoxide-based censuses of protoplanetary disks in Lupus, sigma Orionis, and Chamaeleon I found no disks more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula, which is inconsistent with the existence of exoplanets more massive than Jupiter. Observations and models are converging on the idea that ionization-driven chemistry depletes carbon monoxide in T-Tauri disks. Yet the extent of CO depletion depends on the incident flux of ionizing radiation, and some T-Tauri stars may have winds strong enough to shield their disks from cosmic rays. There is also a range of X-ray luminosities possible for a given stellar mass. Here we use a suite of chemical models, each with a different incident X-ray or cosmic-ray flux, to assess whether CO depletion is a typical outcome for T-Tauri disks. We find that CO dissociation in the outer disk is a robust result for realistic ionization rates, with abundance reductions between 70\% and 99.99\% over 2 Myr of evolution. Furthermore, after the initial dissociation epoch, the inner disk shows some recovery of the CO abundance from CO2 dissociation. In highly ionized disks, CO recovery in the inner disk combined with depletion in the outer disk creates a centrally peaked CO abundance distribution. The emitting area in rare CO isotopologues may be an indirect ionization indicator: in a cluster of disks with similar ages, those with the most compact CO isotopologue emission see the highest ionization rates.},

To assess the possible effects of young stellar clusters on the formation of their constituent stars and planets, this paper constructs the expected radiation fields produced by these clusters. We include both the observed distribution of cluster sizes N in the solar neighborhood and an extended distribution that includes clusters with larger N . The paper presents distributions of the FUV and EUV luminosities for clusters with given stellar membership N , distributions of FUV and EUV luminosity convolved over the expected distribution of cluster sizes N , and the corresponding distributions of FUV and EUV fluxes. These flux distributions are calculated both with and without the effects of extinction. Finally, we consider the effects of variations in the stellar initial mass function on these radiation fields. Taken together, these results specify the distributions of radiation environments that forming solar systems are expected to experience.},
