	abstract = {When stars form within small groups (with N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}100-500 members), their circumstellar disks are exposed to relatively little extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; hν\&gt;13.6 eV) radiation but a great deal of far-ultraviolet (FUV; 6eV\&lt;hν\&lt;13.6eV) radiation ({\textasciitilde}10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} times the local interstellar FUV field) from the most massive stars in the group. This paper calculates the mass-loss rates and evaporation timescales for circumstellar disks exposed to external FUV radiation. Previous work treated large disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} exceeds the critical radius r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}g{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} where the sound speed in the FUV heated surface layer exceeds the escape speed; it has often been assumed that photoevaporation occurs for r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&gt;r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}g{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and is negligible for r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&lt;r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}g{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Since r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}g{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&gt;{\textasciitilde}100 AU for FUV heating, this would imply little mass loss from the planet-forming regions of a disk. In this paper we focus on systems in which photoevaporation is suppressed because r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&lt;r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}g{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and show that significant mass loss still takes place as long as r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}g{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&gt;{\textasciitilde}0.1-0.2. Some of the gas extends beyond the disk edge (or above the disk surface) to larger distances where the temperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. The resulting evaporation rate is a sensitive function of the central stellar mass and disk radius, which determine the escape speed, and the external FUV flux, which determines the temperature structure of the surface layers and outflowing gas. Disks around red dwarfs, low-mass stars with M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&lt;{\textasciitilde}0.5 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, are evaporated and shrink to disk radii r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&lt;{\textasciitilde}15 AU on short timescales t\&lt;{\textasciitilde}10 Myr when exposed to moderate FUV fields with G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=3000 (where G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=1.7 for the local interstellar FUV field). The disks around solar-type stars are more durable. For intense FUV radiation fields with G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}=30,000, however, even these disks shrink to r{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}d{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\&lt;{\textasciitilde}15 AU on timescales t{\textasciitilde}10 Myr. Such fields exist within about 0.7 pc of the center of a cluster with N{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}4000 stars. If our solar system formed in the presence of such strong FUV radiation fields, this mechanism could explain why Neptune and Uranus in our solar system are gas-poor, whereas Jupiter and Saturn are relatively gas-rich. This mechanism for photoevaporation can also limit the production of Kuiper Belt objects and can suppress giant planet formation in sufficiently large clusters, such as the Hyades, especially for disks associated with low-mass stars.},

the outer edge of protoplanetary discs impinged by an ambient radiation

the group/cluster is N ≳ 50), and explore disc sizes ranging
between 20 and 250 au. We evaluate the steady-state structures of the
photoevaporative winds by coupling temperature estimates obtained with a
photodissociation region code with 1D radial hydrodynamical equations.
We also consider the impact of dust dragging and grain growth on the
final mass-loss rates. We find that these winds are much more
significant than have been appreciated hitherto when grain growth is
included in the modelling: in particular, mass-loss rates
≳10-8 M⊙ yr-1 are predicted
even for modest background field strengths (≳30 G0) in
the case of discs that extend to R {\textgreater} 150 au. Grain growth
significantly affects the final mass-loss rates by reducing the average
cross-section at far-ultraviolet wavelengths, and thus allowing a much
more vigorous flow. The radial profiles of observable quantities (in
particular surface density, temperature and velocity patterns) indicate
that these winds have characteristic features that are now potentially
observable with ALMA. In particular, such discs should have extended
gaseous emission that is dust depleted in the outer regions,
characterized by a non-Keplerian rotation curve, and with a radially
increasing temperature gradient.},

A reasonably large fraction of the mass in solids and some gas get incorporated into planets. Here, we review our current understanding of disk evolution and dispersal, and discuss how these might affect planet formation.

	abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are dispersed by viscous evolution and photoevaporation in a few million years; in the interim small, sub-micron-sized dust grains must grow and form planets. The time-varying abundance of small grains in an evolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons, while dust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and resulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in turn, selectively carry small dust grains, leaving the larger particles—which decouple, from the gas—behind in the disk. We study these effects by investigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by EUV, FUV, and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a one-dimensional (1D) multi-fluid approach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface density distributions. The 1D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models constructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and determine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust coagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk lifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is thus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find that photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass ratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result in a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen. We discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet formation, including the formation of gas-poor giants.

	abstract = {The Disk Detective citizen science project aims to find new stars with excess 22-\${\textbackslash}mu\$m emission from circumstellar dust in the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We evaluated 261 Disk Detective objects of interest with imaging with the Robo-AO adaptive optics instrument on the 1.5m telescope at Palomar Observatory and with RetroCam on the 2.5m du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to search for background objects at 0.15''-12'' separations from each target. Our analysis of these data lead us to reject 7\% of targets. Combining this result with statistics from our online image classification efforts implies that at most \$7.9{\textbackslash}\% {\textbackslash}pm 0.2{\textbackslash}\%\$ of AllWISE-selected infrared excesses are good disk candidates. Applying our false positive rates to other surveys, we find that the infrared excess searches of McDonald et al. (2012), McDonald et al. (2017), and Marton et al. (2016) all have false positive rates \${\textgreater}70{\textbackslash}\%\$. Moreover, we find that all thirteen disk candidates in Theissen \& West (2014) with W4 signal-to-noise {\textgreater}3 are false positives. We present 244 disk candidates that have survived vetting by follow-up imaging. Of these, 213 are newly-identified disk systems. Twelve of these are candidate members of comoving pairs based on {\textbackslash}textit\{Gaia\} astrometry, supporting the hypothesis that warm dust is associated with binary systems. We also note the discovery of 22 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m excess around two known members of the Scorpius-Centaurus association, and identify known disk host WISEA J164540.79-310226.6 as a likely Sco-Cen member. Thirty-one of these disk candidates are closer than \${\textbackslash}sim 125\$ pc (including 27 debris disks), making them good targets for direct imaging exoplanet searches.},

	abstract = {Far-ultraviolet (FUV, 6 eV {\textless} h  {\textless} 13:6 eV) radiation has been suggested as the main source of heating of the neutral interstellar gas, and, in this case, it determines whether the thermal balance of the neutral gas results in cold (T \$ 50 100 K) clouds (cold neutral material [CNM]), warm (T \$ 104 K) clouds (warm neutral material [WNM]), or a combination of the two. For gas at ﬁxed mean density, high FUV ﬁelds convert the neutral gas to WNM, while low ﬁelds result in CNM. The main sources of interstellar FUV radiation are short-lived massive stars in associations that form in giant molecular clouds. Using McKee \& Williams’ distribution of birthrates for OB associations in the Galaxy, we determine the expected behavior of the timedependent FUV ﬁeld for random positions in the ISM at the solar circle. The FUV ﬁeld is calculated in two bands (912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ ) and at the wavelength 1400 A˚ . In terms of UÀ17   U= ð10À17 ergs cmÀ3 GÀ1Þ, where U is the energy density of the radiation ﬁeld in some band, we ﬁnd (mean, median) values at the solar circle of UÀ17 ¼ ð15:7; 7:4Þ and (14.2, 7.2) for the 912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ bands, respectively. At 1400 A˚ we ﬁnd (mean, median) values of UÀ17 ¼ ð14:4; 7:5Þ. Our median value for the 912–2070 A˚ band is G0 ¼ 1:6 times Habing’s value for the radiation ﬁeld at the solar circle in this band and quite close to Draine’s value, G0 ¼ 1:7. Habing and Draine’s values are based on observations of sources of FUV radiation in the solar neighborhood, so all three values are close to observed values. Because of attenuation by dust, only associations within about 500 pc contribute signiﬁcantly to the energy density at a given point. Large-angle scattering produces a diﬀuse ﬁeld that is about 10\% of the ﬁeld produced by the sum of direct and small-angle ({\textless}5 ) scattering from discrete sources (the associations), as observed. At a point exposed to the median radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association typically produces about 20\% of the total energy density. At a point exposed to an above average radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association produces most of the energy density. Therefore, the FUV ﬁeld is asymmetric at a given point, and the asymmetry grows for higher ﬁelds. The FUV ﬁeld ﬂuctuates with a variety of amplitudes, the larger ones being less frequent. The mean ﬁeld is about twice the median ﬁeld because of these ﬂuctuations, or spikes, in the radiation ﬁeld. These spikes, which last \$30 Myr, are caused by the infrequent birth of nearby associations. For spikes that are signiﬁcantly higher than the mean ﬁeld, the time interval between spikes is \$2UÀ3=125 Gyr. We also model shorter duration spikes caused by runaway OB stars. The presence of a ﬂuctuating heating rate created by the ﬂuctuating FUV ﬁeld converts CNM to WNM and vice versa.},

The UVBLUE grid, as we named the library, is based on LTE calculations carried out with ATLAS9 and SYNTHE codes developed by R. L. Kurucz and consists of nearly 1800 entries that cover a large volume of the parameter space. It spans a range in TeA from 3000 to 50,000 K, the surface gravity ranges from log g ¼ 0:0 to 5.0 with Álog g ¼ 0:5 dex, while seven chemical compositions are considered: ½M/H ¼ À2:0; À1:5; À1:0; À0:5; þ0:0; þ0:3, and +0.5 dex. For its coverage across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, this library is the most comprehensive one ever computed at high resolution in the short-wavelength spectral range, and useful application can be foreseen for both the study of single stars and in population synthesis models of galaxies and other stellar systems. We brieﬂy discuss some relevant issues for a safe application of the theoretical output to ultraviolet observations, and a comparison of our LTE models with the non-LTE (NLTE) ones from the TLUSTY code is also carried out. NLTE spectra are found, on average, to be slightly ‘‘redder’’ compared to the LTE ones for the same value of TeA, while a larger difference could be detected for weak lines, which are nearly wiped out by the enhanced core emission component in case of NLTE atmospheres. These effects seem to be magniﬁed at low metallicity (typically [M/H] PÀ1). A match with a working sample of 111 stars from the IUE atlas, with available atmosphere parameters from the literature, shows that UVBLUE models provide an accurate description of the main mid- and low-resolution spectral features for stars along the whole sequence from the B to \$G5 type. The comparison sensibly degrades for later spectral types, with supergiant stars that are in general more poorly reproduced than dwarfs. As a possible explanation of this overall trend, we partly invoke the uncertainty in the input atmosphere parameters to compute the theoretical spectra. In addition, one should also consider the important contamination of the IUE stellar sample, where the presence of binary and variable stars certainly works in the sense of artiﬁcially worsening the match between theory and observations.},

We find clear substructures (inner cavities, rings, gaps, and/or spiral arms) in 8 of the sources and hints of such structures in another 4 discs. We construct the disc luminosity function for our targets and perform comparisons to other regions. A simple conversion between flux and dust mass (adopting standard assumptions) indicates that all discs detected at 1.3 mm are massive enough to form one or more rocky planets. In contrast, only {\textasciitilde}50 discs ({\textasciitilde}1/3 of the sample) have enough mass in the form of dust to form the canonical 10 M\_Earth core needed to trigger runaway gas accretion and the formation of gas giant planets, although the total mass of solids already incorporated into bodies larger than cm scales is mostly unconstrained.

Two of the new planets are similarly located to those inferred in the famous HL Tau protoplanetary disc; in CI Tau, additional observational data enables a more complete analysis of the system properties than was possible for HL Tau. Our dust and gas dynamical modeling satisfies every available observational constraint and points to the most massive ensemble of exo-planets ever detected at this age, with its four planets spanning a factor 1000 in orbital radius.Our results show that the association between hot Jupiters and gas giants on wider orbits, observed in older stars, is apparently in place at an early evolutionary stage.},

This both validates their results (which differed significantly from prior semi-analytic estimates) and our new numerical method, the latter of which can now be applied to elements of the problem that the semi-analytic approaches are incapable of modelling. We also obtain the composition of the flow, but given the simple geometry of our models we can only hint at some diagnostics for future observations of externally irradiated discs at this stage. We also discuss the potential for these models as benchmarks for future photochemical-dynamical codes.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the effects of FUV radiation fields from external stars on circumstellar disk evolution. Disks residing in young clusters can be exposed to extreme levels of FUV flux from nearby OB stars, and observations show that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated. Typical FUV flux levels can be factors of {\textasciitilde}10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} higher than the interstellar value. These fields are effective in driving mass loss from circumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the host star, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitational potential well is shallow. We combine viscous evolution (an α-disk model) with an existing FUV photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disk lifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, including mass-loss rates, disk masses, and radii. We also consider the effects of X-ray photoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that for disks around solar-mass stars, externally generated FUV fields are often the dominant mechanism in depleting disk material. For sufficiently large viscosities, FUV fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entire range of parameter space. Disks with viscosity parameter α = 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} are effectively dispersed within 1-3 Myr for higher viscosities (α = 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) disks are dispersed within {\textasciitilde}0.25-0.5 Myr. Furthermore, disk radii are truncated to less than {\textasciitilde}100 AU, which can possibly affect the formation of planets. Our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed masses and radii of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster.},

	abstract = {We study the evolution of protoplanetary discs that would have been precursors of a Trappist-1-like system under the action of accretion and external photoevaporation in different radiation environments. Dust grains swiftly grow above the critical size below which they are entrained in the photoevaporative wind, so although gas is continually depleted, dust is resilient to photoevaporation after only a short time. This means that the ratio of the mass in solids (dust plus planetary) to the mass in gas rises steadily over time. Dust is still stripped early on, and the initial disc mass required to produce the observed 4 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} of Trappist-1 planets is high. For example, assuming a Fatuzzo \&amp; Adams distribution of UV fields, typical initial disc masses have to be \&gt;30 per cent the stellar (which are still Toomre Q stable) for the majority of similar mass M dwarfs to be viable hosts of the Trappist-1 planets. Even in the case of the lowest UV environments observed, there is a strong loss of dust due to photoevaporation at early times from the weakly bound outer regions of the disc. This minimum level of dust loss is a factor of 2 higher than that which would be lost by accretion on to the star during 10 Myr of evolution. Consequently, even in these least irradiated environments, discs that are viable Trappist-1 precursors need to be initially massive (\&gt;10 per cent of the stellar mass).},

	abstract = {We present models in which the photoevaporation of discs around young stars by an external ultraviolet source (as computed by Adams et al.) is coupled with the internal viscous evolution of the discs. These models are applied to the case of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), where the presence of a strong ultraviolet field from the central OB stars, together with a detailed census of circumstellar discs and photoevaporative flows, is well established. In particular we investigate the constraints that are placed on the initial disc properties in the ONC by the twin requirement that most stars possess a disc on a scale of a few astronomical unit (au), but that only a minority (\&lt;20 per cent) are resolved by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at a scale of 50au. We find that these requirements place very weak constraints on the initial radius distribution of circumstellar discs: the resulting size distribution readily forgets the initial radius distribution, owing to the strong positive dependence of the photoevaporation rate on disc radius. Instead, the scarcity of large discs reflects the relative scarcity of initially massive discs (with mass \&gt;0.1M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}solar{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). The ubiquity of discs on a small scale, on the other hand, mainly constrains the time-span over which the discs have been exposed to the ultraviolet field (\&lt;2Myr). We argue that the discs that are resolved by HST represent a population of discs in which self-gravity was important at the time that the dominant central OB star switched on, but that, according to our models, self-gravity is unlikely to be important in these discs at the present time. We discuss the implications of our results for the so-called proplyd lifetime problem.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07374},
	abstract = {When and how planets form in protoplanetary disks is still a topic of discussion. Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now providing results that allow us to have new insights. We collect the masses of confirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence with stellar mass with the same dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in {\textasciitilde}1-3 Myr old star-forming regions. The latter are recalculated by us using the new estimates of their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and multiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing to a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low mass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower than the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses are comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found also by converting the measured planet masses into heavy-element content (core masses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and by comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are heavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient recycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This implies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly ({\textless}0.1-1 Myr) and large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or that disks are continuously replenished of fresh planet-forming material from the environment. These hypotheses can be tested by measuring disk masses in even younger targets and by better understanding if and how the disks are replenished by their surroundings.},

	abstract = {Lifetimes of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are believed to be severely constrained by material depleting mechanisms, including photoevaporative winds due to the host star radiation or external radiation sources. Most previous studies focused on exploring the role of the winds in the exposed PPDs with a single star; however, exploring the evolution of the circumbinary disks with the photoevaporative winds driven by the host star radiation and external radiation sources deserves further investigation. In this study, we investigate the evolution of the circumbinary PPDs with the photoevaporative winds induced by external far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field. We show that this mass-loss process can significantly constrain properties of a circumbinary PPD, including its lifetime, mass and radius. The lifetime of a circumbinary PPD, for instance, is found by a factor of about two longer than a similar circumstellar disk and this enhancement strongly depends on the viscosity parameter. But our model shows that viscosity dependence of the disk lifetime in the circumbinary case is more pronounced compared to the circumstellar case. We also show that dispersal of a circumbinary PPD occurs over a longer time as the disk temperature distribution becomes steeper. Our results also imply that dead zone in a photoevaporative circumbinary PPD extends over a larger radial range in comparison to a circumstellar disk counterpart. We also show that our calculations are in agreement with the observed circumbinary PPDs orbiting equal-mass binaries.},

However, the high resolution images have also shown that the optically thin assumption for millimeter continuum emission may not be valid and the low values of the spectral index may be related to optical depth rather than dust growth. Longer wavelength observations are essential to properly disentangle these effects. The high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will open up the possibilities to spatially resolve disk continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths and beyond, which allows the study of dust growth in disks in the optically thin regime and further constrain models of planet formation.},

Observationally, Massey ﬁnds such a deﬁcit in samples of the ﬁeld population in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, with an initial mass function (IMF) slope of ΓIMF ∼ 4. These IMF measurements represent some of the largest known deviations from the standard Salpeter IMF slope of ΓIMF = 1.35. Here, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the mass function above 20 M for the entire ﬁeld population of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on data from the Runaways and Isolated O Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4). This is a spatially complete census of the entire ﬁeld OB star population of the SMC obtained with the IMACS multi-object spectrograph and MIKE echelle spectrograph on the Magellan telescopes. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of the evolved present-day mass function, we ﬁnd the slope of the ﬁeld IMF above 20 M is ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.4. We extend our IMF measurement to lower masses using BV photometry from the OGLE II survey. We use a statistical approach to generate a probability distribution for the mass of each star from the OGLE photometry, and we again ﬁnd ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.6 for stellar masses from 7 M to 20 M . The discovery and removal of ten runaways in our RIOTS4 sample steepens the ﬁeld IMF slope to ΓIMF = 2.8 ± 0.5. We discuss the possible effects of binarity and star formation history on our results, and conclude that the steep ﬁeld massive star IMF is most likely a real effect.},
