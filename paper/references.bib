  abstract = {Some theories of star formation suggest massive stars may only form in clustered environments, which would create a deﬁcit of massive stars in low-density environments. Observationally, Massey ﬁnds such a deﬁcit in samples of the ﬁeld population in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, with an initial mass function (IMF) slope of ΓIMF ∼ 4. These IMF measurements represent some of the largest known deviations from the standard Salpeter IMF slope of ΓIMF = 1.35. Here, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the mass function above 20 M for the entire ﬁeld population of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on data from the Runaways and Isolated O Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4). This is a spatially complete census of the entire ﬁeld OB star population of the SMC obtained with the IMACS multi-object spectrograph and MIKE echelle spectrograph on the Magellan telescopes. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of the evolved present-day mass function, we ﬁnd the slope of the ﬁeld IMF above 20 M is ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.4. We extend our IMF measurement to lower masses using BV photometry from the OGLE II survey. We use a statistical approach to generate a probability distribution for the mass of each star from the OGLE photometry, and we again ﬁnd ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.6 for stellar masses from 7 M to 20 M . The discovery and removal of ten runaways in our RIOTS4 sample steepens the ﬁeld IMF slope to ΓIMF = 2.8 ± 0.5. We discuss the possible effects of binarity and star formation history on our results, and conclude that the steep ﬁeld massive star IMF is most likely a real effect.},

However, the high resolution images have also shown that the optically thin assumption for millimeter continuum emission may not be valid and the low values of the spectral index may be related to optical depth rather than dust growth. Longer wavelength observations are essential to properly disentangle these effects. The high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will open up the possibilities to spatially resolve disk continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths and beyond, which allows the study of dust growth in disks in the optically thin regime and further constrain models of planet formation.},

  abstract = {Lifetimes of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are believed to be severely constrained by material depleting mechanisms, including photoevaporative winds due to the host star radiation or external radiation sources. Most previous studies focused on exploring the role of the winds in the exposed PPDs with a single star; however, exploring the evolution of the circumbinary disks with the photoevaporative winds driven by the host star radiation and external radiation sources deserves further investigation. In this study, we investigate the evolution of the circumbinary PPDs with the photoevaporative winds induced by external far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field. We show that this mass-loss process can significantly constrain properties of a circumbinary PPD, including its lifetime, mass and radius. The lifetime of a circumbinary PPD, for instance, is found by a factor of about two longer than a similar circumstellar disk and this enhancement strongly depends on the viscosity parameter. But our model shows that viscosity dependence of the disk lifetime in the circumbinary case is more pronounced compared to the circumstellar case. We also show that dispersal of a circumbinary PPD occurs over a longer time as the disk temperature distribution becomes steeper. Our results also imply that dead zone in a photoevaporative circumbinary PPD extends over a larger radial range in comparison to a circumstellar disk counterpart. We also show that our calculations are in agreement with the observed circumbinary PPDs orbiting equal-mass binaries.},

  title = {Why Do Protoplanetary Disks Appear Not Massive Enough to Form the Known Exoplanet Population?},
  abstract = {When and how planets form in protoplanetary disks is still a topic of discussion. Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now providing results that allow us to have new insights. We collect the masses of confirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence with stellar mass with the same dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in \textasciitilde{}1-3 Myr old star-forming regions. The latter are recalculated by us using the new estimates of their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and multiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing to a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low mass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower than the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses are comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found also by converting the measured planet masses into heavy-element content (core masses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and by comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are heavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient recycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This implies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly ($<$0.1-1 Myr) and large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or that disks are continuously replenished of fresh planet-forming material from the environment. These hypotheses can be tested by measuring disk masses in even younger targets and by better understanding if and how the disks are replenished by their surroundings.},

  doi = {10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.11547.x},
  abstract = {We present models in which the photoevaporation of discs around young stars by an external ultraviolet source (as computed by Adams et al.) is coupled with the internal viscous evolution of the discs. These models are applied to the case of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), where the presence of a strong ultraviolet field from the central OB stars, together with a detailed census of circumstellar discs and photoevaporative flows, is well established. In particular we investigate the constraints that are placed on the initial disc properties in the ONC by the twin requirement that most stars possess a disc on a scale of a few astronomical unit (au), but that only a minority (\&lt;20 per cent) are resolved by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at a scale of 50au. We find that these requirements place very weak constraints on the initial radius distribution of circumstellar discs: the resulting size distribution readily forgets the initial radius distribution, owing to the strong positive dependence of the photoevaporation rate on disc radius. Instead, the scarcity of large discs reflects the relative scarcity of initially massive discs (with mass \&gt;0.1M\textsubscript{solar}). The ubiquity of discs on a small scale, on the other hand, mainly constrains the time-span over which the discs have been exposed to the ultraviolet field (\&lt;2Myr). We argue that the discs that are resolved by HST represent a population of discs in which self-gravity was important at the time that the dominant central OB star switched on, but that, according to our models, self-gravity is unlikely to be important in these discs at the present time. We discuss the implications of our results for the so-called proplyd lifetime problem.},

  doi = {10.1093/mnras/sty168},
  abstract = {We study the evolution of protoplanetary discs that would have been precursors of a Trappist-1-like system under the action of accretion and external photoevaporation in different radiation environments. Dust grains swiftly grow above the critical size below which they are entrained in the photoevaporative wind, so although gas is continually depleted, dust is resilient to photoevaporation after only a short time. This means that the ratio of the mass in solids (dust plus planetary) to the mass in gas rises steadily over time. Dust is still stripped early on, and the initial disc mass required to produce the observed 4 M\textsubscript{⊕} of Trappist-1 planets is high. For example, assuming a Fatuzzo \&amp; Adams distribution of UV fields, typical initial disc masses have to be \&gt;30 per cent the stellar (which are still Toomre Q stable) for the majority of similar mass M dwarfs to be viable hosts of the Trappist-1 planets. Even in the case of the lowest UV environments observed, there is a strong loss of dust due to photoevaporation at early times from the weakly bound outer regions of the disc. This minimum level of dust loss is a factor of 2 higher than that which would be lost by accretion on to the star during 10 Myr of evolution. Consequently, even in these least irradiated environments, discs that are viable Trappist-1 precursors need to be initially massive (\&gt;10 per cent of the stellar mass).},

  doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/774/1/9},
  abstract = {This paper explores the effects of FUV radiation fields from external stars on circumstellar disk evolution. Disks residing in young clusters can be exposed to extreme levels of FUV flux from nearby OB stars, and observations show that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated. Typical FUV flux levels can be factors of \textasciitilde{}10\textsuperscript{2}-10\textsuperscript{4} higher than the interstellar value. These fields are effective in driving mass loss from circumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the host star, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitational potential well is shallow. We combine viscous evolution (an α-disk model) with an existing FUV photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disk lifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, including mass-loss rates, disk masses, and radii. We also consider the effects of X-ray photoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that for disks around solar-mass stars, externally generated FUV fields are often the dominant mechanism in depleting disk material. For sufficiently large viscosities, FUV fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entire range of parameter space. Disks with viscosity parameter α = 10\textsuperscript{-3} are effectively dispersed within 1-3 Myr for higher viscosities (α = 10\textsuperscript{-2}) disks are dispersed within \textasciitilde{}0.25-0.5 Myr. Furthermore, disk radii are truncated to less than \textasciitilde{}100 AU, which can possibly affect the formation of planets. Our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed masses and radii of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster.},

  abstract = {There is growing theoretical and observational evidence that protoplanetary disc evolution may be significantly affected by the canonical levels of far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation found in a star-forming environment, leading to substantial stripping of material from the disc outer edge even in the absence of nearby massive stars. In this paper, we perform the first full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the flow from the outer rim of protoplanetary discs externally irradiated by such intermediate strength FUV fields, including direct modelling of the photon-dominated region which is required to accurately compute the thermal properties. We find excellent agreement between our models and the semi-analytic models of Facchini et al. (2016) for the profile of the flow itself, as well as the mass-loss rate and location of their `critical radius'. This both validates their results (which differed significantly from prior semi-analytic estimates) and our new numerical method, the latter of which can now be applied to elements of the problem that the semi-analytic approaches are incapable of modelling. We also obtain the composition of the flow, but given the simple geometry of our models we can only hint at some diagnostics for future observations of externally irradiated discs at this stage. We also discuss the potential for these models as benchmarks for future photochemical-dynamical codes.},

  volume = {481},
  doi = {10.1093/mnras/sty2323},
  abstract = {We present an open access grid of 3930 calculations of externally evaporating protoplanetary discs. This spans a range of disc sizes (1-400 au), disc masses, UV field strengths (10-10\textsuperscript{4} G\textsubscript{0}), and stellar masses (0.05-1.9 M\textsubscript{☉}). The grid is publicly available for download, and offers a means of cheaply including external photoevaporation in disc evolutionary calculations. It can also be queried using an online tool for quick estimates of instantaneous mass-loss rates (e.g for convenient evaluation of real observed systems). The ``FRIED'' grid itself illustrates that for discs around stars ≤0.3 M\textsubscript{☉}, external photoevaporation is effective down to small radii (\&lt;50 au) down to UV fields at least as weak as 10 G\textsubscript{0}. At the other end of the scale, in a 10\textsuperscript{4} G\textsubscript{0} environment photoevaporation is effective down to 1 au even for stellar masses at least as high as 1.9 M\textsubscript{☉}. We also illustrate in which regimes CO survives in the photoevaporative outflow for significant mass-loss rates; marking a system a good candidate to detect external photoevaporation in weak-intermediate UV environments through sub-Keplerian rotation. Finally, we make illustrative mass-loss rate estimates for discs in Taurus based on the Guilloteau et al. (2011) star-disc parameters, finding that around half are expected to have both significant mass-loss and retain CO in the photoevaporative outflow.},

  abstract = {We present high resolution millimeter continuum imaging of the disc surrounding the young star CI Tau, a system hosting the first hot Jupiter candidate in a protoplanetary disc system. The system has extended mm emission on which are superposed three prominent annular gaps at radii \textasciitilde{} 13, 39 and 100 au. We argue that these gaps are most likely to be generated by massive planets so that, including the hot Jupiter, the system contains four gas giant planets at an age of only 2 Myr. Two of the new planets are similarly located to those inferred in the famous HL Tau protoplanetary disc; in CI Tau, additional observational data enables a more complete analysis of the system properties than was possible for HL Tau. Our dust and gas dynamical modeling satisfies every available observational constraint and points to the most massive ensemble of exo-planets ever detected at this age, with its four planets spanning a factor 1000 in orbital radius.Our results show that the association between hot Jupiters and gas giants on wider orbits, observed in older stars, is apparently in place at an early evolutionary stage.},

Here we present 1.3 mm/230 GHz continuum images of 147 targets at 0.2" (28 au) resolution and a typical rms of 0.15 mJy. We detect a total of 133 discs, including the individual components of 11 binary systems and 1 triple system. Fifty-three of these discs are spatially resolved. We find clear substructures (inner cavities, rings, gaps, and/or spiral arms) in 8 of the sources and hints of such structures in another 4 discs. We construct the disc luminosity function for our targets and perform comparisons to other regions. A simple conversion between flux and dust mass (adopting standard assumptions) indicates that all discs detected at 1.3 mm are massive enough to form one or more rocky planets. In contrast, only \textasciitilde{}50 discs (\textasciitilde{}1/3 of the sample) have enough mass in the form of dust to form the canonical 10 M\_Earth core needed to trigger runaway gas accretion and the formation of gas giant planets, although the total mass of solids already incorporated into bodies larger than cm scales is mostly unconstrained.

  abstract = {We present an extended ultraviolet-blue (850–4700 8) library of theoretical stellar spectral energy distributions computed at high resolution, k/Ák ¼ 50;000. The UVBLUE grid, as we named the library, is based on LTE calculations carried out with ATLAS9 and SYNTHE codes developed by R. L. Kurucz and consists of nearly 1800 entries that cover a large volume of the parameter space. It spans a range in TeA from 3000 to 50,000 K, the surface gravity ranges from log g ¼ 0:0 to 5.0 with Álog g ¼ 0:5 dex, while seven chemical compositions are considered: ½M/H ¼ À2:0; À1:5; À1:0; À0:5; þ0:0; þ0:3, and +0.5 dex. For its coverage across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, this library is the most comprehensive one ever computed at high resolution in the short-wavelength spectral range, and useful application can be foreseen for both the study of single stars and in population synthesis models of galaxies and other stellar systems. We brieﬂy discuss some relevant issues for a safe application of the theoretical output to ultraviolet observations, and a comparison of our LTE models with the non-LTE (NLTE) ones from the TLUSTY code is also carried out. NLTE spectra are found, on average, to be slightly ‘‘redder’’ compared to the LTE ones for the same value of TeA, while a larger difference could be detected for weak lines, which are nearly wiped out by the enhanced core emission component in case of NLTE atmospheres. These effects seem to be magniﬁed at low metallicity (typically [M/H] PÀ1). A match with a working sample of 111 stars from the IUE atlas, with available atmosphere parameters from the literature, shows that UVBLUE models provide an accurate description of the main mid- and low-resolution spectral features for stars along the whole sequence from the B to \$G5 type. The comparison sensibly degrades for later spectral types, with supergiant stars that are in general more poorly reproduced than dwarfs. As a possible explanation of this overall trend, we partly invoke the uncertainty in the input atmosphere parameters to compute the theoretical spectra. In addition, one should also consider the important contamination of the IUE stellar sample, where the presence of binary and variable stars certainly works in the sense of artiﬁcially worsening the match between theory and observations.},

  doi = {10.1086/345807},
  abstract = {Far-ultraviolet (FUV, 6 eV $<$ h  $<$ 13:6 eV) radiation has been suggested as the main source of heating of the neutral interstellar gas, and, in this case, it determines whether the thermal balance of the neutral gas results in cold (T \$ 50 100 K) clouds (cold neutral material [CNM]), warm (T \$ 104 K) clouds (warm neutral material [WNM]), or a combination of the two. For gas at ﬁxed mean density, high FUV ﬁelds convert the neutral gas to WNM, while low ﬁelds result in CNM. The main sources of interstellar FUV radiation are short-lived massive stars in associations that form in giant molecular clouds. Using McKee \& Williams’ distribution of birthrates for OB associations in the Galaxy, we determine the expected behavior of the timedependent FUV ﬁeld for random positions in the ISM at the solar circle. The FUV ﬁeld is calculated in two bands (912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ ) and at the wavelength 1400 A˚ . In terms of UÀ17   U= ð10À17 ergs cmÀ3 GÀ1Þ, where U is the energy density of the radiation ﬁeld in some band, we ﬁnd (mean, median) values at the solar circle of UÀ17 ¼ ð15:7; 7:4Þ and (14.2, 7.2) for the 912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ bands, respectively. At 1400 A˚ we ﬁnd (mean, median) values of UÀ17 ¼ ð14:4; 7:5Þ. Our median value for the 912–2070 A˚ band is G0 ¼ 1:6 times Habing’s value for the radiation ﬁeld at the solar circle in this band and quite close to Draine’s value, G0 ¼ 1:7. Habing and Draine’s values are based on observations of sources of FUV radiation in the solar neighborhood, so all three values are close to observed values. Because of attenuation by dust, only associations within about 500 pc contribute signiﬁcantly to the energy density at a given point. Large-angle scattering produces a diﬀuse ﬁeld that is about 10\% of the ﬁeld produced by the sum of direct and small-angle ($<$5 ) scattering from discrete sources (the associations), as observed. At a point exposed to the median radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association typically produces about 20\% of the total energy density. At a point exposed to an above average radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association produces most of the energy density. Therefore, the FUV ﬁeld is asymmetric at a given point, and the asymmetry grows for higher ﬁelds. The FUV ﬁeld ﬂuctuates with a variety of amplitudes, the larger ones being less frequent. The mean ﬁeld is about twice the median ﬁeld because of these ﬂuctuations, or spikes, in the radiation ﬁeld. These spikes, which last \$30 Myr, are caused by the infrequent birth of nearby associations. For spikes that are signiﬁcantly higher than the mean ﬁeld, the time interval between spikes is \$2UÀ3=125 Gyr. We also model shorter duration spikes caused by runaway OB stars. The presence of a ﬂuctuating heating rate created by the ﬂuctuating FUV ﬁeld converts CNM to WNM and vice versa.},

  abstract = {The Disk Detective citizen science project aims to find new stars with excess 22-\$\mu\$m emission from circumstellar dust in the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We evaluated 261 Disk Detective objects of interest with imaging with the Robo-AO adaptive optics instrument on the 1.5m telescope at Palomar Observatory and with RetroCam on the 2.5m du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to search for background objects at 0.15''-12'' separations from each target. Our analysis of these data lead us to reject 7\% of targets. Combining this result with statistics from our online image classification efforts implies that at most \$7.9\\% \pm 0.2\\%\$ of AllWISE-selected infrared excesses are good disk candidates. Applying our false positive rates to other surveys, we find that the infrared excess searches of McDonald et al. (2012), McDonald et al. (2017), and Marton et al. (2016) all have false positive rates \$$>$70\\%\$. Moreover, we find that all thirteen disk candidates in Theissen \& West (2014) with W4 signal-to-noise $>$3 are false positives. We present 244 disk candidates that have survived vetting by follow-up imaging. Of these, 213 are newly-identified disk systems. Twelve of these are candidate members of comoving pairs based on \textit\{Gaia\} astrometry, supporting the hypothesis that warm dust is associated with binary systems. We also note the discovery of 22 \$\mu\$m excess around two known members of the Scorpius-Centaurus association, and identify known disk host WISEA J164540.79-310226.6 as a likely Sco-Cen member. Thirty-one of these disk candidates are closer than \$\sim 125\$ pc (including 27 debris disks), making them good targets for direct imaging exoplanet searches.},

We find that the \{M\}\textsubscript{\{dust\vphantom\}}\vphantom\{\}\{--\}\{M\}\textsubscript{* } relation is steeper than linear and of the form M \textsubscript{dust} ∝ (M \textsubscript{*})\textsuperscript{1.3-1.9}, where the range in the power-law index reflects two extremes of the possible relation between the average dust temperature and stellar luminosity.

Theoretical models of grain growth, drift, and fragmentation reproduce this trend and suggest that disks are in the fragmentation-limited regime.

  abstract = {In this paper, we address two issues related to primordial disk evolution in three clusters (NGC 1333, IC 348, and Orion A) observed by the INfrared Spectra of Young Nebulous Clusters (IN-SYNC) project. First, in each cluster, averaged over the spread of age, we investigate how disk lifetime is dependent on stellar mass. The general relation in IC 348 and Orion A is that primordial disks around intermediate mass stars (2--5\$M\_\{\odot\}\$) evolve faster than those around loss mass stars (0.1--1\$M\_\{\odot\}\$), which is consistent with previous results. However, considering only low mass stars, we do not find a significant dependence of disk frequency on stellar mass. These results can help to better constrain theories on gas giant planet formation timescales. Secondly, in the Orion A molecular cloud, in the mass range of 0.35--0.7\$M\_\{\odot\}\$, we provide the most robust evidence to date for disk evolution within a single cluster exhibiting modest age spread. By using surface gravity as an age indicator and employing 4.5 \$\mu m\$ excess as a primordial disk diagnostic, we observe a trend of decreasing disk frequency for older stars. The detection of intra-cluster disk evolution in NGC 1333 and IC 348 is tentative, since the slight decrease of disk frequency for older stars is a less than 1-\$\sigma\$ effect.},

  title = {Photoevaporation of {{Circumstellar Disks Due}} to {{External Far}}-{{Ultraviolet Radiation}} in {{Stellar Aggregates}}},
  volume = {611},
  doi = {10.1086/421989},
  abstract = {When stars form within small groups (with N\textsubscript{*}\textasciitilde{}100-500 members), their circumstellar disks are exposed to relatively little extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; hν\&gt;13.6 eV) radiation but a great deal of far-ultraviolet (FUV; 6eV\&lt;hν\&lt;13.6eV) radiation (\textasciitilde{}10\textsuperscript{3} times the local interstellar FUV field) from the most massive stars in the group. This paper calculates the mass-loss rates and evaporation timescales for circumstellar disks exposed to external FUV radiation. Previous work treated large disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius r\textsubscript{d} exceeds the critical radius r\textsubscript{g} where the sound speed in the FUV heated surface layer exceeds the escape speed; it has often been assumed that photoevaporation occurs for r\textsubscript{d}\&gt;r\textsubscript{g} and is negligible for r\textsubscript{d}\&lt;r\textsubscript{g}. Since r\textsubscript{g}\&gt;\textasciitilde{}100 AU for FUV heating, this would imply little mass loss from the planet-forming regions of a disk. In this paper we focus on systems in which photoevaporation is suppressed because r\textsubscript{d}\&lt;r\textsubscript{g} and show that significant mass loss still takes place as long as r\textsubscript{d}/r\textsubscript{g}\&gt;\textasciitilde{}0.1-0.2. Some of the gas extends beyond the disk edge (or above the disk surface) to larger distances where the temperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. The resulting evaporation rate is a sensitive function of the central stellar mass and disk radius, which determine the escape speed, and the external FUV flux, which determines the temperature structure of the surface layers and outflowing gas. Disks around red dwarfs, low-mass stars with M\textsubscript{*}\&lt;\textasciitilde{}0.5 M\textsubscript{solar}, are evaporated and shrink to disk radii r\textsubscript{d}\&lt;\textasciitilde{}15 AU on short timescales t\&lt;\textasciitilde{}10 Myr when exposed to moderate FUV fields with G\textsubscript{0}=3000 (where G\textsubscript{0}=1.7 for the local interstellar FUV field). The disks around solar-type stars are more durable. For intense FUV radiation fields with G\textsubscript{0}=30,000, however, even these disks shrink to r\textsubscript{d}\&lt;\textasciitilde{}15 AU on timescales t\textasciitilde{}10 Myr. Such fields exist within about 0.7 pc of the center of a cluster with N\textsubscript{*}\textasciitilde{}4000 stars. If our solar system formed in the presence of such strong FUV radiation fields, this mechanism could explain why Neptune and Uranus in our solar system are gas-poor, whereas Jupiter and Saturn are relatively gas-rich. This mechanism for photoevaporation can also limit the production of Kuiper Belt objects and can suppress giant planet formation in sufficiently large clusters, such as the Hyades, especially for disks associated with low-mass stars.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks dissipate rapidly after the central star forms, on time-scales comparable to those inferred for planet formation. In order to allow the formation of planets, disks must survive the dispersive effects of UV and X-ray photoevaporation for at least a few Myr. Viscous accretion depletes significant amounts of the mass in gas and solids, while photoevaporative flows driven by internal and external irradiation remove most of the gas. A reasonably large fraction of the mass in solids and some gas get incorporated into planets. Here, we review our current understanding of disk evolution and dispersal, and discuss how these might affect planet formation. We also discuss existing observational constraints on dispersal mechanisms and future directions.},

  doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/804/1/29},
  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are dispersed by viscous evolution and photoevaporation in a few million years; in the interim small, sub-micron-sized dust grains must grow and form planets. The time-varying abundance of small grains in an evolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons, while dust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and resulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in turn, selectively carry small dust grains, leaving the larger particles—which decouple, from the gas—behind in the disk. We study these effects by investigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by EUV, FUV, and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a one-dimensional (1D) multi-fluid approach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface density distributions. The 1D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models constructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and determine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust coagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk lifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is thus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find that photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass ratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result in a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen. We discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet formation, including the formation of gas-poor giants. After gas disk dispersal, ̃ 3× \{\{10\}\vphantom\}\textsuperscript{-4}\vphantom\{\} M \textsubscript{☉ } of mass in solids typically remain, comparable to the solids inventory of our solar system.},

  abstract = {Recently, three stellar sequences separated in age by about 1 Myr were discovered in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC; Beccari et al. 2017). Kroupa et al. (2018) suggest that such small dense subpopulations eject all their OB stars via the decay of unstable few-body systems such that the gas can recombine and form new stars. This explains the multisequence phenomenon without introducing an extra mechanism into star formation theory. In this work, we apply the recently updated primordial binary distribution model (Belloni et al. 2017; implemented here in a new version of MCLUSTER) and perform a large set of direct N-body simulations to investigate the feasibility of this dynamical scenario. Our results suggest that if 3-4 OB stars in the ONC formed primordially mass-segregated in the cluster centre with a maximum separation of about 0.003 pc, all OB stars have a high chance (50-70 per cent) to escape from the centre and do not come back within 1 Myr and the dynamical ejection scenario is a viable channel to form short-age-interval multipopulation sequences as observed in the ONC. This is also consistent with self-regulated star formation.},

  title = {The Viscous Evolution of Circumstellar Discs in Young Star Clusters},
  copyright = {All rights reserved},
  doi = {10.1093/mnras/sty2721},
  abstract = {Stars with circumstellar disks may form in environments with high stellar and gas densities which affects the disks through processes like truncation from dynamical encounters, ram pressure stripping, and external photoevaporation. Circumstellar disks also undergo viscous evolution which leads to disk expansion. Previous work indicates that dynamical truncation and viscous evolution play a major role in determining circumstellar disk size and mass distributions. However, it remains unclear under what circumstances each of these two processes dominates. Here we present results of simulations of young stellar clusters taking viscous evolution and dynamical truncations into account. We model the embedded phase of the clusters by adding leftover gas as a background potential which can be present through the whole evolution of the cluster, or expelled after 1 Myr. We compare our simulation results to actual observations of disk sizes, disk masses, and accretion rates in star forming regions. We argue that the relative importance of dynamical truncations and the viscous evolution of the disks changes with time and cluster density. Viscous evolution causes the importance of dynamical encounters to increase in time, but the encounters cease soon after the expulsion of the leftover gas. For the clusters simulated in this work, viscous growth dominates the evolution of the disks.},
