Observationally, Massey ﬁnds such a deﬁcit in samples of the ﬁeld population in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds, with an initial mass function (IMF) slope of ΓIMF ∼ 4. These IMF measurements represent some of the largest known deviations from the standard Salpeter IMF slope of ΓIMF = 1.35. Here, we carry out a comprehensive investigation of the mass function above 20 M for the entire ﬁeld population of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), based on data from the Runaways and Isolated O Type Star Spectroscopic Survey of the SMC (RIOTS4). This is a spatially complete census of the entire ﬁeld OB star population of the SMC obtained with the IMACS multi-object spectrograph and MIKE echelle spectrograph on the Magellan telescopes. Based on Monte Carlo simulations of the evolved present-day mass function, we ﬁnd the slope of the ﬁeld IMF above 20 M is ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.4. We extend our IMF measurement to lower masses using BV photometry from the OGLE II survey. We use a statistical approach to generate a probability distribution for the mass of each star from the OGLE photometry, and we again ﬁnd ΓIMF = 2.3 ± 0.6 for stellar masses from 7 M to 20 M . The discovery and removal of ten runaways in our RIOTS4 sample steepens the ﬁeld IMF slope to ΓIMF = 2.8 ± 0.5. We discuss the possible effects of binarity and star formation history on our results, and conclude that the steep ﬁeld massive star IMF is most likely a real effect.},

However, the high resolution images have also shown that the optically thin assumption for millimeter continuum emission may not be valid and the low values of the spectral index may be related to optical depth rather than dust growth. Longer wavelength observations are essential to properly disentangle these effects. The high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) will open up the possibilities to spatially resolve disk continuum emission at centimeter wavelengths and beyond, which allows the study of dust growth in disks in the optically thin regime and further constrain models of planet formation.},

  abstract = {Lifetimes of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are believed to be severely constrained by material depleting mechanisms, including photoevaporative winds due to the host star radiation or external radiation sources. Most previous studies focused on exploring the role of the winds in the exposed PPDs with a single star; however, exploring the evolution of the circumbinary disks with the photoevaporative winds driven by the host star radiation and external radiation sources deserves further investigation. In this study, we investigate the evolution of the circumbinary PPDs with the photoevaporative winds induced by external far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field. We show that this mass-loss process can significantly constrain properties of a circumbinary PPD, including its lifetime, mass and radius. The lifetime of a circumbinary PPD, for instance, is found by a factor of about two longer than a similar circumstellar disk and this enhancement strongly depends on the viscosity parameter. But our model shows that viscosity dependence of the disk lifetime in the circumbinary case is more pronounced compared to the circumstellar case. We also show that dispersal of a circumbinary PPD occurs over a longer time as the disk temperature distribution becomes steeper. Our results also imply that dead zone in a photoevaporative circumbinary PPD extends over a larger radial range in comparison to a circumstellar disk counterpart. We also show that our calculations are in agreement with the observed circumbinary PPDs orbiting equal-mass binaries.},

  title = {Why do protoplanetary disks appear not massive enough to form the known exoplanet population?},
  abstract = {When and how planets form in protoplanetary disks is still a topic of discussion. Exoplanet detection surveys and protoplanetary disk surveys are now providing results that allow us to have new insights. We collect the masses of confirmed exoplanets and compare their dependence with stellar mass with the same dependence for protoplanetary disk masses measured in ~1-3 Myr old star-forming regions. The latter are recalculated by us using the new estimates of their distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes. We note that single and multiple exoplanetary systems form two different populations, probably pointing to a different formation mechanism for massive giant planets around very low mass stars. While expecting that the mass in exoplanetary systems is much lower than the measured disk masses, we instead find that exoplanetary systems masses are comparable or higher than the most massive disks. This same result is found also by converting the measured planet masses into heavy-element content (core masses for the giant planets and full masses for the super-Earth systems) and by comparing this value with the disk dust masses. Unless disk dust masses are heavily underestimated, this is a big conundrum. An extremely efficient recycling of dust particles in the disk cannot solve this conundrum. This implies that either the cores of planets have formed very rapidly (<0.1-1 Myr) and large amount of gas is expelled on the same timescales from the disk, or that disks are continuously replenished of fresh planet-forming material from the environment. These hypotheses can be tested by measuring disk masses in even younger targets and by better understanding if and how the disks are replenished by their surroundings.},

  abstract = {We present models in which the photoevaporation of discs around young stars by an external ultraviolet source (as computed by Adams et al.) is coupled with the internal viscous evolution of the discs. These models are applied to the case of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), where the presence of a strong ultraviolet field from the central OB stars, together with a detailed census of circumstellar discs and photoevaporative flows, is well established. In particular we investigate the constraints that are placed on the initial disc properties in the ONC by the twin requirement that most stars possess a disc on a scale of a few astronomical unit (au), but that only a minority (&lt;20 per cent) are resolved by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) at a scale of 50au. We find that these requirements place very weak constraints on the initial radius distribution of circumstellar discs: the resulting size distribution readily forgets the initial radius distribution, owing to the strong positive dependence of the photoevaporation rate on disc radius. Instead, the scarcity of large discs reflects the relative scarcity of initially massive discs (with mass &gt;0.1M<SUB>solar</SUB>). The ubiquity of discs on a small scale, on the other hand, mainly constrains the time-span over which the discs have been exposed to the ultraviolet field (&lt;2Myr). We argue that the discs that are resolved by HST represent a population of discs in which self-gravity was important at the time that the dominant central OB star switched on, but that, according to our models, self-gravity is unlikely to be important in these discs at the present time. We discuss the implications of our results for the so-called proplyd lifetime problem.},

  abstract = {We study the evolution of protoplanetary discs that would have been precursors of a Trappist-1-like system under the action of accretion and external photoevaporation in different radiation environments. Dust grains swiftly grow above the critical size below which they are entrained in the photoevaporative wind, so although gas is continually depleted, dust is resilient to photoevaporation after only a short time. This means that the ratio of the mass in solids (dust plus planetary) to the mass in gas rises steadily over time. Dust is still stripped early on, and the initial disc mass required to produce the observed 4 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> of Trappist-1 planets is high. For example, assuming a Fatuzzo &amp; Adams distribution of UV fields, typical initial disc masses have to be &gt;30 per cent the stellar (which are still Toomre Q stable) for the majority of similar mass M dwarfs to be viable hosts of the Trappist-1 planets. Even in the case of the lowest UV environments observed, there is a strong loss of dust due to photoevaporation at early times from the weakly bound outer regions of the disc. This minimum level of dust loss is a factor of 2 higher than that which would be lost by accretion on to the star during 10 Myr of evolution. Consequently, even in these least irradiated environments, discs that are viable Trappist-1 precursors need to be initially massive (&gt;10 per cent of the stellar mass).},

  doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/774/1/9},
  abstract = {This paper explores the effects of FUV radiation fields from external stars on circumstellar disk evolution. Disks residing in young clusters can be exposed to extreme levels of FUV flux from nearby OB stars, and observations show that disks in such environments are being actively photoevaporated. Typical FUV flux levels can be factors of ~10<SUP>2</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> higher than the interstellar value. These fields are effective in driving mass loss from circumstellar disks because they act at large radial distance from the host star, i.e., where most of the disk mass is located, and where the gravitational potential well is shallow. We combine viscous evolution (an α-disk model) with an existing FUV photoevaporation model to derive constraints on disk lifetimes, and to determine disk properties as functions of time, including mass-loss rates, disk masses, and radii. We also consider the effects of X-ray photoevaporation from the host star using an existing model, and show that for disks around solar-mass stars, externally generated FUV fields are often the dominant mechanism in depleting disk material. For sufficiently large viscosities, FUV fields can efficiently photoevaporate disks over the entire range of parameter space. Disks with viscosity parameter α = 10<SUP>-3</SUP> are effectively dispersed within 1-3 Myr for higher viscosities (α = 10<SUP>-2</SUP>) disks are dispersed within ~0.25-0.5 Myr. Furthermore, disk radii are truncated to less than ~100 AU, which can possibly affect the formation of planets. Our model predictions are consistent with the range of observed masses and radii of proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster.},

In this paper, we perform the first full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of the flow from the outer rim of protoplanetary discs externally irradiated by such intermediate strength FUV fields, including direct modelling of the photon-dominated region which is required to accurately compute the thermal properties. We find excellent agreement between our models and the semi-analytic models of Facchini et al. (2016) for the profile of the flow itself, as well as the mass-loss rate and location of their `critical radius'. This both validates their results (which differed significantly from prior semi-analytic estimates) and our new numerical method, the latter of which can now be applied to elements of the problem that the semi-analytic approaches are incapable of modelling. We also obtain the composition of the flow, but given the simple geometry of our models we can only hint at some diagnostics for future observations of externally irradiated discs at this stage. We also discuss the potential for these models as benchmarks for future photochemical-dynamical codes.},

We also illustrate in which regimes CO survives in the photoevaporative outflow for significant mass-loss rates; marking a system a good candidate to detect external photoevaporation in weak-intermediate UV environments through sub-Keplerian rotation. Finally, we make illustrative mass-loss rate estimates for discs in Taurus based on the Guilloteau et al. (2011) star-disc parameters, finding that around half are expected to have both significant mass-loss and retain CO in the photoevaporative outflow.},

  abstract = {We present high resolution millimeter continuum imaging of the disc surrounding the young star CI Tau, a system hosting the first hot Jupiter candidate in a protoplanetary disc system. The system has extended mm emission on which are superposed three prominent annular gaps at radii ~ 13, 39 and 100 au. We argue that these gaps are most likely to be generated by massive planets so that, including the hot Jupiter, the system contains four gas giant planets at an age of only 2 Myr. Two of the new planets are similarly located to those inferred in the famous HL Tau protoplanetary disc; in CI Tau, additional observational data enables a more complete analysis of the system properties than was possible for HL Tau. Our dust and gas dynamical modeling satisfies every available observational constraint and points to the most massive ensemble of exo-planets ever detected at this age, with its four planets spanning a factor 1000 in orbital radius.Our results show that the association between hot Jupiters and gas giants on wider orbits, observed in older stars, is apparently in place at an early evolutionary stage.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Ophiuchus DIsc Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA), a project aiming to study the entire population of Spitzer-selected protoplanetary discs in the Ophiuchus Molecular Cloud (~300 objects) from both millimeter continuum and CO isotopologues data. Here we present 1.3 mm/230 GHz continuum images of 147 targets at 0.2" (28 au) resolution and a typical rms of 0.15 mJy. We detect a total of 133 discs, including the individual components of 11 binary systems and 1 triple system. Fifty-three of these discs are spatially resolved. We find clear substructures (inner cavities, rings, gaps, and/or spiral arms) in 8 of the sources and hints of such structures in another 4 discs. We construct the disc luminosity function for our targets and perform comparisons to other regions. A simple conversion between flux and dust mass (adopting standard assumptions) indicates that all discs detected at 1.3 mm are massive enough to form one or more rocky planets. In contrast, only ~50 discs (~1/3 of the sample) have enough mass in the form of dust to form the canonical 10 M_Earth core needed to trigger runaway gas accretion and the formation of gas giant planets, although the total mass of solids already incorporated into bodies larger than cm scales is mostly unconstrained. The distribution in continuum disc sizes in our sample is heavily weighted towards compact discs: most detected discs have radii < 15 au, while only 23 discs (~15% of the targets) have radii > 30 au.},

  abstract = {We present an extended ultraviolet-blue (850–4700 8) library of theoretical stellar spectral energy distributions computed at high resolution, k/Ák ¼ 50;000. The UVBLUE grid, as we named the library, is based on LTE calculations carried out with ATLAS9 and SYNTHE codes developed by R. L. Kurucz and consists of nearly 1800 entries that cover a large volume of the parameter space. It spans a range in TeA from 3000 to 50,000 K, the surface gravity ranges from log g ¼ 0:0 to 5.0 with Álog g ¼ 0:5 dex, while seven chemical compositions are considered: ½M/H ¼ À2:0; À1:5; À1:0; À0:5; þ0:0; þ0:3, and +0.5 dex. For its coverage across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, this library is the most comprehensive one ever computed at high resolution in the short-wavelength spectral range, and useful application can be foreseen for both the study of single stars and in population synthesis models of galaxies and other stellar systems. We brieﬂy discuss some relevant issues for a safe application of the theoretical output to ultraviolet observations, and a comparison of our LTE models with the non-LTE (NLTE) ones from the TLUSTY code is also carried out. NLTE spectra are found, on average, to be slightly ‘‘redder’’ compared to the LTE ones for the same value of TeA, while a larger difference could be detected for weak lines, which are nearly wiped out by the enhanced core emission component in case of NLTE atmospheres. These effects seem to be magniﬁed at low metallicity (typically [M/H] PÀ1). A match with a working sample of 111 stars from the IUE atlas, with available atmosphere parameters from the literature, shows that UVBLUE models provide an accurate description of the main mid- and low-resolution spectral features for stars along the whole sequence from the B to $G5 type. The comparison sensibly degrades for later spectral types, with supergiant stars that are in general more poorly reproduced than dwarfs. As a possible explanation of this overall trend, we partly invoke the uncertainty in the input atmosphere parameters to compute the theoretical spectra. In addition, one should also consider the important contamination of the IUE stellar sample, where the presence of binary and variable stars certainly works in the sense of artiﬁcially worsening the match between theory and observations.},

  doi = {10.1086/345807},
  abstract = {Far-ultraviolet (FUV, 6 eV < h  < 13:6 eV) radiation has been suggested as the main source of heating of the neutral interstellar gas, and, in this case, it determines whether the thermal balance of the neutral gas results in cold (T $ 50 100 K) clouds (cold neutral material [CNM]), warm (T $ 104 K) clouds (warm neutral material [WNM]), or a combination of the two. For gas at ﬁxed mean density, high FUV ﬁelds convert the neutral gas to WNM, while low ﬁelds result in CNM. The main sources of interstellar FUV radiation are short-lived massive stars in associations that form in giant molecular clouds. Using McKee & Williams’ distribution of birthrates for OB associations in the Galaxy, we determine the expected behavior of the timedependent FUV ﬁeld for random positions in the ISM at the solar circle. The FUV ﬁeld is calculated in two bands (912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ ) and at the wavelength 1400 A˚ . In terms of UÀ17   U= ð10À17 ergs cmÀ3 GÀ1Þ, where U is the energy density of the radiation ﬁeld in some band, we ﬁnd (mean, median) values at the solar circle of UÀ17 ¼ ð15:7; 7:4Þ and (14.2, 7.2) for the 912–1100 and 912–2070 A˚ bands, respectively. At 1400 A˚ we ﬁnd (mean, median) values of UÀ17 ¼ ð14:4; 7:5Þ. Our median value for the 912–2070 A˚ band is G0 ¼ 1:6 times Habing’s value for the radiation ﬁeld at the solar circle in this band and quite close to Draine’s value, G0 ¼ 1:7. Habing and Draine’s values are based on observations of sources of FUV radiation in the solar neighborhood, so all three values are close to observed values. Because of attenuation by dust, only associations within about 500 pc contribute signiﬁcantly to the energy density at a given point. Large-angle scattering produces a diﬀuse ﬁeld that is about 10% of the ﬁeld produced by the sum of direct and small-angle (<5 ) scattering from discrete sources (the associations), as observed. At a point exposed to the median radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association typically produces about 20% of the total energy density. At a point exposed to an above average radiation ﬁeld, the brightest association produces most of the energy density. Therefore, the FUV ﬁeld is asymmetric at a given point, and the asymmetry grows for higher ﬁelds. The FUV ﬁeld ﬂuctuates with a variety of amplitudes, the larger ones being less frequent. The mean ﬁeld is about twice the median ﬁeld because of these ﬂuctuations, or spikes, in the radiation ﬁeld. These spikes, which last $30 Myr, are caused by the infrequent birth of nearby associations. For spikes that are signiﬁcantly higher than the mean ﬁeld, the time interval between spikes is $2UÀ3=125 Gyr. We also model shorter duration spikes caused by runaway OB stars. The presence of a ﬂuctuating heating rate created by the ﬂuctuating FUV ﬁeld converts CNM to WNM and vice versa.},

  shorttitle = {Follow-up Imaging of Disk Candidates from the Disk Detective Citizen Science Project},
  abstract = {The Disk Detective citizen science project aims to find new stars with excess 22-$\mu$m emission from circumstellar dust in the AllWISE data release from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We evaluated 261 Disk Detective objects of interest with imaging with the Robo-AO adaptive optics instrument on the 1.5m telescope at Palomar Observatory and with RetroCam on the 2.5m du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to search for background objects at 0.15''-12'' separations from each target. Our analysis of these data lead us to reject 7% of targets. Combining this result with statistics from our online image classification efforts implies that at most $7.9\% \pm 0.2\%$ of AllWISE-selected infrared excesses are good disk candidates. Applying our false positive rates to other surveys, we find that the infrared excess searches of McDonald et al. (2012), McDonald et al. (2017), and Marton et al. (2016) all have false positive rates $>70\%$. Moreover, we find that all thirteen disk candidates in Theissen & West (2014) with W4 signal-to-noise >3 are false positives. We present 244 disk candidates that have survived vetting by follow-up imaging. Of these, 213 are newly-identified disk systems. Twelve of these are candidate members of comoving pairs based on \textit{Gaia} astrometry, supporting the hypothesis that warm dust is associated with binary systems. We also note the discovery of 22 $\mu$m excess around two known members of the Scorpius-Centaurus association, and identify known disk host WISEA J164540.79-310226.6 as a likely Sco-Cen member. Thirty-one of these disk candidates are closer than $\sim 125$ pc (including 27 debris disks), making them good targets for direct imaging exoplanet searches.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address two issues related to primordial disk evolution in three clusters (NGC 1333, IC 348, and Orion A) observed by the INfrared Spectra of Young Nebulous Clusters (IN-SYNC) project. First, in each cluster, averaged over the spread of age, we investigate how disk lifetime is dependent on stellar mass. The general relation in IC 348 and Orion A is that primordial disks around intermediate mass stars (2--5$M_{\odot}$) evolve faster than those around loss mass stars (0.1--1$M_{\odot}$), which is consistent with previous results. However, considering only low mass stars, we do not find a significant dependence of disk frequency on stellar mass. These results can help to better constrain theories on gas giant planet formation timescales. Secondly, in the Orion A molecular cloud, in the mass range of 0.35--0.7$M_{\odot}$, we provide the most robust evidence to date for disk evolution within a single cluster exhibiting modest age spread. By using surface gravity as an age indicator and employing 4.5 $\mu m$ excess as a primordial disk diagnostic, we observe a trend of decreasing disk frequency for older stars. The detection of intra-cluster disk evolution in NGC 1333 and IC 348 is tentative, since the slight decrease of disk frequency for older stars is a less than 1-$\sigma$ effect.},

  volume = {611},
  doi = {10.1086/421989},
  abstract = {When stars form within small groups (with N<SUB>*</SUB>~100-500 members), their circumstellar disks are exposed to relatively little extreme-ultraviolet (EUV; hν&gt;13.6 eV) radiation but a great deal of far-ultraviolet (FUV; 6eV&lt;hν&lt;13.6eV) radiation (~10<SUP>3</SUP> times the local interstellar FUV field) from the most massive stars in the group. This paper calculates the mass-loss rates and evaporation timescales for circumstellar disks exposed to external FUV radiation. Previous work treated large disks and/or intense radiation fields in which the disk radius r<SUB>d</SUB> exceeds the critical radius r<SUB>g</SUB> where the sound speed in the FUV heated surface layer exceeds the escape speed; it has often been assumed that photoevaporation occurs for r<SUB>d</SUB>&gt;r<SUB>g</SUB> and is negligible for r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;r<SUB>g</SUB>. Since r<SUB>g</SUB>&gt;~100 AU for FUV heating, this would imply little mass loss from the planet-forming regions of a disk. In this paper we focus on systems in which photoevaporation is suppressed because r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;r<SUB>g</SUB> and show that significant mass loss still takes place as long as r<SUB>d</SUB>/r<SUB>g</SUB>&gt;~0.1-0.2. Some of the gas extends beyond the disk edge (or above the disk surface) to larger distances where the temperature is higher, the escape speed is lower, and an outflow develops. The resulting evaporation rate is a sensitive function of the central stellar mass and disk radius, which determine the escape speed, and the external FUV flux, which determines the temperature structure of the surface layers and outflowing gas. Disks around red dwarfs, low-mass stars with M<SUB>*</SUB>&lt;~0.5 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, are evaporated and shrink to disk radii r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;~15 AU on short timescales t&lt;~10 Myr when exposed to moderate FUV fields with G<SUB>0</SUB>=3000 (where G<SUB>0</SUB>=1.7 for the local interstellar FUV field). The disks around solar-type stars are more durable. For intense FUV radiation fields with G<SUB>0</SUB>=30,000, however, even these disks shrink to r<SUB>d</SUB>&lt;~15 AU on timescales t~10 Myr. Such fields exist within about 0.7 pc of the center of a cluster with N<SUB>*</SUB>~4000 stars. If our solar system formed in the presence of such strong FUV radiation fields, this mechanism could explain why Neptune and Uranus in our solar system are gas-poor, whereas Jupiter and Saturn are relatively gas-rich. This mechanism for photoevaporation can also limit the production of Kuiper Belt objects and can suppress giant planet formation in sufficiently large clusters, such as the Hyades, especially for disks associated with low-mass stars.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are dispersed by viscous evolution and photoevaporation in a few million years; in the interim small, sub-micron-sized dust grains must grow and form planets. The time-varying abundance of small grains in an evolving disk directly affects gas heating by far-ultraviolet (FUV) photons, while dust evolution affects photoevaporation by changing the disk opacity and resulting penetration of FUV photons in the disk. Photoevaporative flows, in turn, selectively carry small dust grains, leaving the larger particles—which decouple, from the gas—behind in the disk. We study these effects by investigating the evolution of a disk subject to viscosity, photoevaporation by EUV, FUV, and X-rays, dust evolution, and radial drift using a one-dimensional (1D) multi-fluid approach (gas + different dust grain sizes) to solve for the evolving surface density distributions. The 1D evolution is augmented by 1+1D models constructed at each epoch to obtain the instantaneous disk structure and determine photoevaporation rates. The implementation of a dust coagulation/fragmentation model results in a marginal decrease in disk lifetimes when compared to models with no dust evolution; the disk lifetime is thus found to be relatively insensitive to the evolving dust opacity. We find that photoevaporation can cause significant reductions in the gas/dust mass ratio in the planet-forming regions of the disk as it evolves, and may result in a corresponding increase in heavy element abundances relative to hydrogen. We discuss implications for theories of planetesimal formation and giant planet formation, including the formation of gas-poor giants.

This explains the multisequence phenomenon without introducing an extra mechanism into star formation theory. In this work, we apply the recently updated primordial binary distribution model (Belloni et al. 2017; implemented here in a new version of MCLUSTER) and perform a large set of direct N-body simulations to investigate the feasibility of this dynamical scenario. Our results suggest that if 3-4 OB stars in the ONC formed primordially mass-segregated in the cluster centre with a maximum separation of about 0.003 pc, all OB stars have a high chance (50-70 per cent) to escape from the centre and do not come back within 1 Myr and the dynamical ejection scenario is a viable channel to form short-age-interval multipopulation sequences as observed in the ONC. This is also consistent with self-regulated star formation.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are quasi-steady structures whose evolution and dispersal determine the environment for planet formation. I review the theory of protoplanetary disk evolution and its connection to observations. Substantial progress has been made in elucidating the physics of potential angular momentum transport processes—including self-gravity, magnetorotational instability, baroclinic instabilities, and magnetic braking—and in developing testable models for disk dispersal via photoevaporation. The relative importance of these processes depends upon the initial mass, size, and magnetization of the disk, and subsequently on its opacity, ionization state, and external irradiation. Disk dynamics is therefore coupled to star formation, pre-main-sequence stellar evolution, and dust coagulation during the early stages of planet formation and may vary dramatically from star to star. The importance of validating theoretical models is emphasized, with the key observations being those that probe disk structure on the scales between 1 AU and 10 AU, where theory is most uncertain.},

It is highly probable that this cluster environment influenced various properties of the solar system such as its chemical composition, size, and the orbital parameters of some of its constituting bodies. <BR /> Aims: In the Milky Way, clusters with more than 2000 stars only form in two types - starburst clusters and leaky clusters -, each following a unique temporal development in the mass-radius plane. The aim is here to determine the encounter probability in the range relevant to solar system formation for starburst or leaky cluster environments as a function of cluster age. Methods.N-body methods were used to investigate the cluster dynamics and the effect of gravitational interactions between cluster members on young solar-type stars surrounded by discs. <BR /> Results: Using the now available knowledge of the cluster density at a given cluster age we demonstrate that in starburst clusters the central densities over the first 5 Myr are so high (initially &gt; 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> pc<SUP>-3</SUP>) that hardly any discs with solar system building potential would survive this phase. This makes starburst clusters an unlikely environment for the formation of our solar system. Instead it is highly probable that the solar system formed in a leaky cluster (often classified as OB association). We demonstrate that an encounter determining the characteristic properties existing in our solar systems most likely happened very early on (&lt;2 Myr) in its formation history and that after 5 Myr the likelihood of a solar-type star experiencing such an encounter in a leaky cluster is negligible even if it was still part of the bound remnant. This explains why the solar system could develop and maintain its high circularity later in its development.},

  abstract = {We present a methodology to interpret observations of protoplanetary discs where a flyby, also called a tidal encounter, is suspected. In case of a flyby, protoplanetary discs can be significantly disturbed. The resulting dynamical and kinematical signatures can last for several thousands of years after the flyby and hence deeply affect the evolution of the disc. These effects are stronger for closer encounters and more massive perturbers. For the very same flyby parameters, varying the inclination of the perturber's orbit produces a broad range of disc structures: spirals, bridges, warps and cavities. We study this kind of features both in the gas and in the dust for grains ranging from 1 {\mu}m to 10 cm in size. Interestingly, the dust exhibits a different dynamical behaviour compared to the gas because of gas-drag effects. Finally, flybys can also trigger high accretion events in the disc-hosting star, readily similar to FU Orionis-type outbursts. All this information can be used to infer the flyby parameters from an incomplete set of observations at different wavelengths. Therefore, the main scope of our flyby scene investigation (FSI) methodology is to help to interpret recent "puzzling" disc observations.},

We investigate the potential contribution to the SNIa rate from the population of merging double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. We aim to develope a model that fits the observed SNIa progenitors as well as the observed close double white dwarf population. We differentiate between two scenarios for the common envelope (CE) evolution; the alpha-formalism based on the energy equation and the gamma-formalism that is based on the angular momentum equation. In one model we apply the alpha-formalism always. In the second model the gamma-formalism is applied, unless the binary contains a compact object or the CE is triggered by a tidal instability for which the alpha-formalism is used. The binary population synthesis code SeBa was used to evolve binary systems from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of double white dwarfs and subsequent mergers. SeBa has been thoroughly updated since the last publication of the content of the code. The limited sample of observed double white dwarfs is better represented by the simulated population using the gamma-formalism than the alpha-formalism. For both CE formalisms, we find that although the morphology of the simulated delay time distribution matches that of the observations within the errors, the normalisation and time-integrated rate per stellar mass are a factor 7-12 lower than observed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the simulated populations of merging double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are discussed and put in the context of alternative SNIa models for merging double white dwarfs.},

To illustrate the model, we apply it to the formation of neutron stars, both single and in binaries. The eccentricity of primordial binaries allows a wide, non-interacting binary to survive the first and second supernovae in many more cases than suggested by previous calculations that assume circular orbits. Mass transfer in binaries enhances the rate of type I supernovae with respect to that of the type II supernovae. A sizable fraction of initial binaries merge into a single star; 10-15% of the type II supernovae are from such mergers. Models in which neutron stars receive a kick velocity at birth predict birth rates for wide and close radio-pulsar binaries, and for high-mass (including Be-) X-ray binaries that are roughly in agreement with observations. All our models produce too many Her X-1 type binaries. The formation rate of
radio-pulsars that remain in a binary after the first supernova
explosion and are released at the second supernova event is predicted by our models to be comparable to the formation rate of recycled binary radio pulsars, i.e. less than a few per cent of the formation rate of single radio pulsars.},

  abstract = {The cyanide radical CN is abundant in protoplanetary disks, with line fluxes often comparable to those of $^{13}$CO. It is known to be sensitive to UV irradiation of the upper disk atmosphere, with models predicting ring-shaped emission. We seek to characterize the CN emission from 94 Class II disks in the Lupus star forming region, compare it to observations in other regions, and interpret our observations with a grid of models. The CN emission morphology is discussed for two primordial disks, Sz 71 and Sz 98, and modeled in more detail. ALMA observed CN N=3-2 in Lupus disks down to sensitivities better than previous surveys. Models constructed with the physico-chemical code DALI are used to study the integrated fluxes of the disks and resolved emission of CN in disks without (dust) substructures. We find that CN N=3-2 is bright, and detected in 38% of sources, but its disk-integrated flux is not strongly correlated to either $^{13}$CO or continuum flux. Compared to pre-ALMA single-dish surveys, no significant difference in the CN flux distributions in Lupus and Taurus-Auriga is found, although $\rho$ Ophiuchus disks may be fainter on average. We find ring-shaped CN emission with peak radii of ~50 AU in two resolved disks. We conclude that a large fraction of sources is faint in CN; only exponential gas surface density cutoffs at $R_{c} \leq 15$ AU can reconcile observations with models. This is the first observational evidence of such a compact gas disk population in Lupus. Absolute intensities and the emission morphology of CN are reproduced by DALI models without the need for any continuum substructure; they are unrelated to the CO snowline location. These observations and the successful modeling of these rings provide a new probe of the structure and conditions in disks, and particularly their incident UV radiation field, if disk size is determined by the data.},

While models based on this simplified geometry provide only approximations to the true processes of instability-driven mass and angular momentum transport, their simplicity makes them invaluable tools for both semi-analytic modeling and simulations of long-term evolution where two- or three-dimensional calculations are too computationally costly. Despite the utility of these models, the only publicly-available frameworks for simulating them are rather specialized and non-general. Here we describe a highly flexible, general numerical method for simulating viscous thin disks with arbitrary rotation curves, viscosities, boundary conditions, grid spacings, equations of state, and rates of gain or loss of mass (e.g., through winds) and energy (e.g., through radiation). Our method is based on a conservative, finite-volume, second-order accurate discretization of the equations, which we solve using an unconditionally-stable implicit scheme. We implement Anderson acceleration to speed convergence of the scheme, and show that this leads to factor of ∼5 speed gains over non-accelerated methods in realistic problems, though the amount of speedup is highly problem-dependent. We have implemented our method in the new code Viscous Accretion Disk Evolution Resource (VADER), which is freely available for download from https://bitbucket.org/krumholz/vader/ under the terms of the GNU General Public License.},

However, the first steps of planet formation are likely to occur already when the protostar and disk are still embedded in their natal envelope. The initial conditions for planet formation may thus be provided by these young embedded disks, of which the physical and chemical structure is poorly characterized. <BR /> Aims: We aim to constrain the midplane temperature structure, one of the critical unknowns, of the embedded disk around L1527. In particular, we set out to determine whether there is an extended cold outer region where CO is frozen out, as is the case for Class II disks. This will show whether young disks are indeed warmer than their more evolved counterparts, as is predicted by physical models. <BR /> Methods: We used archival ALMA data of <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 2-1, C<SUP>18</SUP>O J = 2-1 and N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP>J = 3-2 to directly observe the midplane of the near edge-on L1527 disk.

Moreover, the effect of CO freeze-out on the <SUP>13</SUP>CO, C<SUP>18</SUP>O and N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP> emission was investigated using 3D radiative transfer modeling. <BR /> Results: Optically thick <SUP>13</SUP>CO and C<SUP>18</SUP>O emission is observed throughout the disk and inner envelope, while N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP> is not detected. Both CO isotopologues have brightness temperatures ≳25 K along the midplane. Disk and envelope emission can be disentangled kinematically, because the largest velocities are reached in the disk. A power law radial temperature profile constructed using the highest midplane temperature at these velocities suggest that the temperature is above 20 K out to at least 75 au, and possibly throughout the entire 125 au disk. The radiative transfer models show that a model without CO freeze-out in the disk matches the C<SUP>18</SUP>O observations better than a model with the CO snowline at 70 au. In addition, there is no evidence for a large (order of magnitude) depletion of CO. <BR /> Conclusions: The disk around L1527 is likely to be warm enough to have CO present in the gas phase throughout the disk, suggesting that young embedded disks can indeed be warmer than the more evolved Class II disks.},

  abstract = {Magnetized winds may be important in dispersing protoplanetary disks and influencing planet formation. We carry out global full magnetohydrodynamic simulations in axisymmetry, coupled with ray-tracing radiative transfer, consistent thermochemistry, and non-ideal MHD diffusivities. Magnetized models lacking EUV photons ($h\nu>13.6\ \mathrm{eV}$) feature warm molecular outflows that have typical poloidal speeds $\gtrsim 4\ \mathrm{km\ s}^{-1}$. When the magnetization is sufficient to drive accretion rates $\sim 10^{-8}\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, the wind mass-loss rate is comparable. Such outflows are driven not centrifugally but by the pressure of toroidal magnetic fields produced by bending the poloidal field. Both the accretion and outflow rates increase with the poloidal field energy density, the former almost linearly. The mass-loss rate is also strongly affected by ionization due to UV and X-ray radiation near the wind base. Adding EUV irradiation to the system heats, ionizes, and accelerates the part of the outflow nearest the symmetry axis, but reduces the overall mass-loss rate by exerting pressure on the wind base. Most of our models are non-turbulent, but some with reduced dust abundance and therefore higher ionization fractions exhibit magnetorotational instabilities near the base of the wind.},

  title = {ALMA detections of the youngest protostars in Ophiuchus},
  abstract = {We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 1.1 mm dust continuum and CO 2-1 emission toward six dense cores within the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. We detect compact, sub-arcsecond continuum structures toward three targets, two of which (Oph A N6 and SM1) are located in the Ophiuchus A ridge. Two targets, SM1 and GSS 30, contain two compact sources within the ALMA primary beam. We argue that several of the compact structures are small ($R \lesssim 80$ au) accretion disks around young protostars, due to their resolved, elongated structures, coincident radio and x-ray detections, or bipolar outflow detections. While CO line wings extend to $\pm 10-20$ km s$^{-1}$ for the more evolved sources GSS 30 IRS3 and IRS1, CO emission toward other sources, where detected, only extends a few km s$^{-1}$ from the cloud $v_\mathrm{LSR}$. The dust spectral index toward the compact objects suggests that the disks are either optically thick at 1.1 mm, or that significant grain growth has already occurred. We identify, for the first time, a single compact continuum source ($R \sim 100$ au) toward N6 embedded within a larger continuum structure. SM1N is extended in the continuum but is highly centrally concentrated, with a density profile that follows a $r^{-1.3}$ power law within 200 au, and additional structure suggested by the uv-data. Both N6 and SM1N show no clear bipolar outflows with velocities greater than a few km s$^{-1}$ from the cloud velocity. These sources are candidates to be the youngest protostars or first hydrostatic cores in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud.},

  abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects,
including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than ˜100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than
˜104M⊙; the size of the cluster and its
environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and
computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

The paper presents distributions of the FUV and EUV luminosities for clusters with given stellar membership N , distributions of FUV and EUV luminosity convolved over the expected distribution of cluster sizes N , and the corresponding distributions of FUV and EUV fluxes. These flux distributions are calculated both with and without the effects of extinction. Finally, we consider the effects of variations in the stellar initial mass function on these radiation fields.

  abstract = {Based on the interstellar CO/H2 ratio, carbon monoxide-based censuses of protoplanetary disks in Lupus, sigma Orionis, and Chamaeleon I found no disks more massive than the minimum-mass solar nebula, which is inconsistent with the existence of exoplanets more massive than Jupiter. Observations and models are converging on the idea that ionization-driven chemistry depletes carbon monoxide in T-Tauri disks. Yet the extent of CO depletion depends on the incident flux of ionizing radiation, and some T-Tauri stars may have winds strong enough to shield their disks from cosmic rays. There is also a range of X-ray luminosities possible for a given stellar mass. Here we use a suite of chemical models, each with a different incident X-ray or cosmic-ray flux, to assess whether CO depletion is a typical outcome for T-Tauri disks. We find that CO dissociation in the outer disk is a robust result for realistic ionization rates, with abundance reductions between 70% and 99.99% over 2 Myr of evolution. Furthermore, after the initial dissociation epoch, the inner disk shows some recovery of the CO abundance from CO2 dissociation. In highly ionized disks, CO recovery in the inner disk combined with depletion in the outer disk creates a centrally peaked CO abundance distribution. The emitting area in rare CO isotopologues may be an indirect ionization indicator: in a cluster of disks with similar ages, those with the most compact CO isotopologue emission see the highest ionization rates.},

We use N-body simulations to explore how their evolution depends on the system size N and the initial conditions. Motivated by recent observations suggesting that stellar groups begin their evolution with subvirial speeds, this study compares subvirial starting states with virial starting states. Multiple realizations of equivalent cases (100 simulations per initial condition) are used to build up a robust statistical description of these systems, e.g., the probability distribution of closest approaches, the mass profiles, and the probability distribution for the radial location of cluster members. These results provide a framework from which to assess the effects of groups/clusters on the processes of star and planet formation and to study cluster evolution. The distributions of radial positions are used in conjunction with the probability distributions of the expected far-ultraviolet (FUV) luminosities (calculated here as a function of cluster size N) to determine the radiation exposure of circumstellar disks. The distributions of closest approaches are used in conjunction with scattering cross sections (calculated here as a function of stellar mass using ~10<SUP>5</SUP> Monte Carlo scattering experiments) to determine the probability of disruption for newly formed solar systems. We use the nearby cluster NGC 1333 as a test case in this investigation. The main conclusion of this study is that clusters in this size range have only a modest effect on forming planetary systems. The interaction rates are low, so that the typical solar system experiences a single encounter with closest approach distance b~1000 AU. The radiation exposure is also low, with median FUV flux G<SUB>0</SUB>~900 (1.4 ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>), so that photoevaporation of circumstellar disks is only important beyond 30 AU. Given the low interaction rates and modest radiation levels, we suggest that solar system disruption is a rare event in these clusters.},

  volume = {327},
  abstract = {We study the hydrodynamic evolution of protostellar disks under the influence of a central source of ionizing radiation and its stellar wind. Here we examine the effects of an important contribution to the diffuse radiation field - the scattering of hydrogen-ionizing photons on dust grains (dust scattering). We present and discuss the resulting changes in the evolution of the system under a variety of conditions both with and without dust scattering. An important consequence is the significant increase in the photoevaporation rate. Depending on the scattering coefficient assumed, the presence of dust within the ionized region can increase the density and flow of ionized material and correspondingly shorten the disk's lifetime by a factor of two or more. In addition, the temperature of the ionized outflowing gas is slightly higher and remains more nearly constant over the extent of the ionized region, even in the regions shadowed from direct stellar radiation. We also investigate the influence of other major parameters of the problem, wind velocity, wind mass loss rate, and stellar ionizing flux, by systematically varying these parameters. Over a large range of values of stellar ionizing flux S_star_ we find a power law dependence of the disk mass loss rate due to photoionization ̇(M)_ph_{prop.to}S_star_^0.58^ which is comparable to analytic estimates. Deviations from this power law occurred for moderate values S_star_&gt;10^47^s^-1^ due to our finite disk size and for low values S_star_&lt;~10^45^s^-1^ due to the resulting non-steady flow pattern. Because we have assumed a warm (T=~10^4^K) wind and have included heating, cooling, ionization, and recombination processes in the stellar wind, we find that the disk's photoevaporation rate depends on the assumed wind parameters in a manner which can be explained by the loss of UV ionizing photons very close to the central star.},

  abstract = {It has recently been noted that many discs around T Tauri stars appear to comprise only a few Jupiter masses of gas and dust. Using millimetre surveys of discs within six local star formation regions, we confirm this result, and find that only a few per cent of young stars have enough circumstellar material to build gas giant planets, in standard core accretion models. Since the frequency of observed exoplanets is greater than this, there is a `missing-mass' problem. As alternatives to simply adjusting the conversion of dust flux to disc mass, we investigate three other classes of solution. Migration of planets could hypothetically sweep up the disc mass reservoir more efficiently, but trends in multiplanet systems do not support such a model, and theoretical models suggest that the gas accretion time-scale is too short for migration to sweep the disc. Enhanced inner-disc mass reservoirs are possible, agreeing with predictions of disc evolution through self-gravity, but not adding to millimetre dust flux as the inner disc is optically thick. Finally, the incidence of massive discs is shown to be higher at the protostellar stages, Classes 0 and I, where discs substantial enough to form planets via core accretion are abundant enough to match the frequency of exoplanets. Gravitational instability may also operate in the Class 0 epoch, where half the objects have potentially unstable discs of &gt;~30 per cent of the stellar mass. However, recent calculations indicate that forming gas giants inside 50 au by instability is unlikely, even in such massive discs. Overall, the results presented suggest that the canonically `protoplanetary' discs of Class II T Tauri stars have globally low masses in dust observable at millimetre wavelengths, and conversion to larger bodies (anywhere from small rocks up to planetary cores) must already have occurred.},

We combine catalogues of resolved protoplanetary discs (PPDs) and young stellar objects in the solar neighbourhood to analyse the PPD size distribution as a function of ambient stellar density. By running Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests between the PPD radii at different densities, we find empirical evidence, at the >97% confidence level, for a change in the PPD radius distribution at ambient stellar densities Σ ≳ 103.5
pc-2. This coincides with a simple theoretical estimate for the truncation of PPDs or planetary systems by dynamical encounters. If this agreement is causal, the ongoing disruption of PPDs and planetary systems limits the possible existence of planets in the habitable zone, with shorter lifetimes at higher host stellar masses and ambient densities. Therefore, habitable planets are not likely to be present in long-lived stellar clusters, and may have been ejected altogether to form a population of unbound, free-floating planets. We conclude that, while highly suggestive, our results should be verified through other methods. Our simple model shows that truncations should lead to a measurable depletion of the PPD mass function that can be detected with ALMA observations of the densest nearby and young clusters.

  doi = {10.1051/0004-6361/201015914},
  abstract = {Context. Circumstellar disks are expected to evolve quickly in massive young clusters harboring many OB-type stars. Two processes have been proposed to drive the disk evolution in such cruel environments: (1) gravitational interaction between circumstellar disks and nearby passing stars (stellar encounters); and (2) photoevaporation by UV photons from massive stars. The relative importance of both mechanisms is not well understood. Studies of massive young star clusters can provide observational constraints on the processes of driving disk evolution. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the properties of young stars and their disks in the NGC 6357 complex, concentrating on the most massive star cluster within the complex: Pismis 24. <BR /> Methods: We use infrared data from the 2MASS and Spitzer GLIMPSE surveys, complemented with our own deep Spitzer imaging of the central regions of Pismis 24, in combination with X-ray data to search for young stellar objects (YSOs) in NGC 6357 complex. The infrared data constrain the disk presence and are complemented by optical photometric and spectroscopic observations, obtained with VLT/VIMOS, that constrain the properties of the central stars. For those stars with reliable spectral types we combine spectra and photometry to estimate the mass and age. For cluster members without reliable spectral types we obtain the mass and age probability distributions from R and I-band photometry, assuming these stars have the same extinction distribution as those in the "spectroscopic" sample. We compare the disk properties in the Pismis 24 cluster with those in other clusters/star-forming regions employing infrared color-color diagrams. <BR /> Results: We discover two new young clusters in the NGC 6357 complex. We give a revised distance estimate for Pismis 24 of 1.7 ± 0.2 kpc. We find that the massive star Pis 24-18 is a binary system, with the secondary being the main X-ray source of the pair. We provide photometry in 9 bands between 0.55 and 9 μm for the members of the Pismis 24 cluster. We derive the cluster mass function and find that up to the completeness limit at low masses it agrees well with the initial mass function of the Trapezium cluster. We derive a median age of 1 Myr for the Pismis 24 cluster members. We find five proplyds in HST archival imaging of the cluster, four of which are newly found. In all cases the proplyd tails are pointing directly away from the massive star system Pis 24-1. One proplyd shows a second tail, pointing away from Pis 24-2, suggesting this object is being photoevaporated from two directions simultaneously. We find that the global disk frequency (~30%) in Pismis 24 is much lower than some other clusters of similar age, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. When comparing the disk frequencies in 19 clusters/star-forming regions of various ages and different (massive) star content, we find that the disks in clusters harboring extremely massive stars (typically earlier than O5), like Pismis 24, are dissipated roughly twice as quickly as in clusters/star-forming regions without extremely massive stars. Within Pismis 24, we find that the disk frequency within a projected distance of 0.6 pc from Pis 24-1 is substantially lower than at larger radii (~19% vs. ~37%). We argue for a combination of photoevaporation and irradiation with ionizing UV photons from nearby massive stars, causing increased MRI-induced turbulence and associated accretion activity, to play an important role in the dissipation of low-mass star disks in Pismis 24.

We imaged five individual fields at 856 μm containing 22 Hubble Space Telescope ( HST )-identified proplyds and detected 21 of them. Eight of those disks were detected for the first time at submillimeter wavelengths, including the most prominent, well-known proplyd in the entire Orion Nebula, 114-426. Thermal dust emission in excess of any free-free component was measured in all but one of the detected disks, and ranged between 1 and 163 mJy, with resulting disk masses of 0.3-79 M jup . An additional 26 stars with no prior evidence of associated disks in HST observations were also imaged within the 5 fields, but only 2 were detected. The disk mass upper limits for the undetected targets, which include OB stars, θ 1 Ori C, and θ 1 Ori F, range from 0.1 to0.6 M jup . Combining these ALMA data with previous Submillimeter Array observations, we find a lack of massive ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] gsim3 M jup ) disks in the extreme-UV-dominated region of Orion, within 0.03 pc of θ 1 Ori C. At larger separations from θ 1 Ori C, in the far-UV-dominated region, there is a wide range of disk masses, similar to what is found in low-mass star forming regions. Taken together, these results suggest that a rapid dissipation of disk masses likely inhibits potential planet formation in the extreme-UV-dominated regions of OB associations, but leaves disks in the far-UV-dominated regions relatively unaffected.},

Sednitos roam the outer regions of the Solar system between the Egeworth-Kuiper belt and the Oort Cloud, in extraordinary wide (a &gt; 150 au) orbits with a large perihelion distance of q &gt; 30 au compared to the Earth's (a ≡ 1 au and eccentricity e ≡ (1 - q/a) ≃ 0.0167 or q ≃ 1 au).

They also have similar argument of perihelion ω = 340° ± 55°. There is no ready explanation for their origin. Here we show that these orbital parameters are typical for a captured population from the planetesimal disc of another star. Assuming that the orbital elements of Sednitos have not changed since they acquired their orbits, we reconstruct the encounter that led to their capture. We conclude that they might have been captured in a near miss with a 1.8 M<SUB>☉</SUB> star that impacted the Sun at ≃ 340 au at an inclination with respect to the ecliptic of 17°-34° with a relative velocity at infinity of ̃4.3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>.

  abstract = {We use self-consistent numerical simulations of the evolution and disruption of the Sun's birth cluster in the Milky Way potential to investigate the present-day phase-space distribution of the Sun's siblings. The simulations include the gravitational N-body forces within the cluster and the effects of stellar evolution on the cluster population. In addition, the gravitational forces due to the Milky Way potential are accounted for in a self-consistent manner. Our aim is to understand how the astrometric and radial velocity data from the Gaia mission can be used to pre-select solar sibling candidates. We vary the initial conditions of the Sun's birth cluster, as well as the parameters of the Galactic potential. In particular, we use different configurations and strengths of the bar and spiral arms. We show that the disruption time-scales of the cluster are insensitive to the details of the non-axisymmetric components of the Milky Way model and we make predictions, averaged over the different simulated possibilities, about the number of solar siblings that should appear in surveys such as Gaia or GALAH. We find a large variety of present-day phase-space distributions of solar siblings, which depend on the cluster initial conditions and the Milky Way model parameters. We show that nevertheless robust predictions can be made about the location of the solar siblings in the space of parallaxes (ϖ), proper motions (μ) and radial velocities (V<SUB>r</SUB>). By calculating the ratio of the number of simulated solar siblings to that of the number of stars in a model Galactic disc, we find that this ratio is above 0.5 in the region given by: ϖ ≥ 5 mas, 4 ≤ μ ≤ 6 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and -2 ≤ V<SUB>r</SUB> ≤ 0 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Selecting stars from this region should increase the probability of success in identifying solar siblings through follow-up observations. However the proposed pre-selection criterion is sensitive to our assumptions, in particular about the Galactic potential. Using a more realistic potential (e.g. including transient spiral structure and molecular clouds) would make the pre-selection of solar sibling candidates based on astrometric and radial velocity data very inefficient. This reinforces the need for large-scale surveys to determine precise astrophysical properties of stars, in particular their ages and chemical abundances, if we want to identify the solar family.},

  abstract = {Finding solar siblings, that is, stars that formed in the same cluster as the Sun, will yield information about the conditions at the Sun's birthplace. We search for solar sibling candidates in AMBRE, the very large spectra database of solar vicinity stars. Since the ages and chemical abundances of solar siblings are very similar to those of the Sun, we carried out a chemistry- and age-based search for solar sibling candidates. We used high-resolution spectra to derive precise stellar parameters and chemical abundances of the stars. We used these spectroscopic parameters together with Gaia DR2 astrometric data to derive stellar isochronal ages. Gaia data were also used to study the kinematics of the sibling candidates. From the about 17000 stars that are characterized within the AMBRE project, we first selected 55 stars whose metallicities are closest to the solar value (-0.1 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.1 dex). For these stars we derived precise chemical abundances of several iron-peak, alpha- and neutron-capture elements, based on which we selected 12 solar sibling candidates with average abundances and metallicities between -0.03 to 0.03 dex. Our further selection left us with 4 candidates with stellar ages that are compatible with the solar age within observational uncertainties. For the 2 of the hottest candidates, we derived the carbon isotopic ratios, which are compatible with the solar value. HD186302 is the most precisely characterized and probably the most probable candidate of our 4 best candidates. Very precise chemical characterization and age estimation is necessary to identify solar siblings. We propose that in addition to typical chemical tagging, the study of isotopic ratios can give further important information about the relation of sibling candidates with the Sun. Ideally, asteroseismic age determinations of the candidates could solve the problem of imprecise isochronal ages.},

For this sample of 336 stars, we observe 3 mm emission above the 3 σ noise level toward 10 sources, six of which have also been detected optically in silhouette against the bright nebular background. In addition, we detect 20 objects in 3 mm continuum emission that do not correspond to known near-IR cluster members. Comparisons of our measured fluxes with longer wavelength observations enable rough separation of dust emission from thermal free-free emission, and we find substantial dust emission toward most objects. For the sample of 10 objects detected at both 3 mm and near-IR wavelengths, eight exhibit substantial dust emission. Excluding the two high-mass stars (θ<SUP>1</SUP> Ori A and the BN object) and assuming a gas-to-dust ratio of 100, we estimate circumstellar masses ranging from 0.13 to 0.39 M<SUB>solar</SUB>.

The percentage of stars in Orion surrounded by disks more massive than ~0.1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> is consistent with the disk mass distribution in Taurus, and we argue that massive disks in Orion do not appear to be truncated through close encounters with high-mass stars. Comparison of the average disk mass and number of massive dusty structures in Orion with similar surveys of the NGC 2024 and IC 348 clusters is used to constrain the evolutionary timescales of massive circumstellar disks in clustered environments.},

  abstract = {Context: The external destruction of protoplanetary discs in a clustered environment acts mainly due to two mechanisms: gravitational drag by stellar encounters and evaporation by strong stellar winds and radiation. It is a fundamental question whether either of these mechanisms is important for the stellar evolution and planet formation process in young star clusters. <BR />Aims: We focus on the effect of stellar encounters in young dense clusters and investigate whether there are any observables that could trace this mechanism and its impact on disc evolution. If encounters play a role in disc destruction, one would expect that stars devoid of disc material would show unexpectedly high velocities as an outcome of close interactions. We want to quantify this effect by numerical simulations and compare it to observations. <BR />Methods: As a model cluster we chose the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We reanalyzed observational data of the ONC to find encounter signatures in the velocity distribution and a possible correlation with signatures of circumstellar discs. We use the ++ code to model the dynamics of an ONC-like cluster and analyze the velocity distribution and the disc-mass loss due to encounters. <BR />Results: We found from the observational data that 8 to 18 stars leave the ONC with velocities several times the velocity dispersion. The majority of these high-velocity stars are young low-mass stars (t ≲ 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr, m ≈ 0.2-0.3 M<SUB>☉</SUB>), among them several lacking infrared excess emission. Interestingly, the high-velocity stars are found only in two separate regions of the ONC - i) close to the cluster centre and ii) in the outer cluster region. Our simulations give an explanation for the location of the high-velocity stars and provide evidence for a strong correlation between location and disc destruction. <BR />Conclusions: The high-velocity stars can be explained as the outcome of close three-body encounters; the partial lack of disc signatures is attributed to gravitational interaction. The spatial distribution of the high-velocity stars reflects the initial structure and dynamics of the ONC. Our approach can be generalized to study the evolution of other young dense star clusters, like the Arches cluster, back in time.},

  abstract = {Context: HD 141569, a triple star system, has been intensively observed and studied because of its massive debris disk. Until recently, it was regarded as a gravitationally bound triple system but recent measurements of the HD 141569A radial velocity seem to invalidate this hypothesis. The flyby scenario therefore has to be further investigated to test its compatibility with the observed disk structures. Aims: We present a study of the flyby scenario for the HD 141569 system by considering 3 variants: a sole flyby, a flyby associated with one planet embedded in the disk and a flyby with two planets in the disk. We discuss the merits of each one to reproduce the scattered light observations of the disk. Methods: We first use analytical calculations to reduce the parameter space of the 2 stellar companion orbit and then perform N-body numerical simulations of the flyby encounter using symplectic integration, taking into account the gravitational influence of the stars and the planets on massless test particles. Results: The binary orbit is found to be almost fixed by the observational constraint on an edge-on plane with respect to the observers. If the binary had an influence on the disk structure, it should have a passing time at the periapsis between 5000 and 8000 years ago and a distance at periapsis between 600 and 900 AU. It also appears that the best scenario to reproduce the disk morphology is a flyby with 1 planet embedded in the disk. For a 2 MJ planet, its orbital eccentricity must be around 0.2 while for a 8 MJ planet, it must be below 0.1. In the two cases, its apoapsis is about 130 AU. Conclusions: Although the global disk shape is reasonably well reproduced, some observed features cannot be explained by the present model and the likehood of the flyby event remains an issue for the scenario explored in this paper. Dynamically speaking, HD 141569 is still a puzzling system.},

  abstract = {Context. Proto-planetary disks are thought to provide the initial 
environment for planetary system formation. The dust and gas
distribution and its evolution with time is one of the key elements in
the process. Aims: We attempt to characterize the radial
distribution of dust in disks around a sample of young stars from an
observational point of view, and, when possible, in a model-independent
way, by using parametric laws. Methods: We used the IRAM PdBI
interferometer to provide very high angular resolution (down to 0.4'' in
some sources) observations of the continuum at 1.3 mm and 3 mm around a
sample of T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga region. The sample includes
single and multiple systems, with a total of 23 individual disks. We
used track-sharing observing mode to minimize the biases. We fitted
these data with two kinds of models: a "truncated power law" model and a
model presenting an exponential decay at the disk edge ("viscous"
model). Results: Direct evidence for tidal truncation is found in
the multiple systems. The temperature of the mm-emitting dust is
constrained in a few systems. Unambiguous evidence for large grains is
obtained by resolving out disks with very low values of the dust
emissivity index β. In most disks that are sufficiently resolved at
two different wavelengths, we find a radial dependence of β, which
appears to increase from low values (as low as 0) at the center to about
1.7-2 at the disk edge. The same behavior could apply to all studied
disks. It introduces further ambiguities in interpreting the brightness
profile, because the regions with apparent β ≈ 0 can also be
interpreted as being optically thick when their brightness temperature
is high enough. Despite the added uncertainty on the dust absorption
coefficient, the characteristic size of the disk appears to increase
with a higher estimated star age. Conclusions: These results
provide the first direct evidence of the radial dependence of the grain
size in proto-planetary disks. Constraints of the surface density
distributions and their evolution remain ambiguous because of a
degeneracy with the β(r) law.

  abstract = {Only star clusters that are sufficiently compact and massive survive largely unharmed beyond 10 . However, their compactness means a high stellar density, which can lead to strong gravitational interactions between the stars. As young stars are often initially surrounded by protoplanetary disks and later on potentially by planetary systems, the question arises to what degree these strong gravitational interactions influence planet formation and the properties of planetary systems. Here, we perform simulations of the evolution of compact high-mass clusters like Trumpler 14 and Westerlund 2 from the embedded to the gas-free phase and study the influence of stellar interactions. We concentrate on the development of the mean disk size in these environments. Our simulations show that in high-mass open clusters 80%─90% of all disks/planetary systems should be smaller than 50 just as a result of the strong stellar interactions in these environments. Already in the initial phases, three to four close flybys lead to typical disk sizes within the range of 18─27 . Afterward, the disk sizes are altered only to a small extent. Our findings agree with the recent observation that the disk sizes in the once dense environment of the Upper Scorpio OB association, NGC 2362, and h/χPersei are at least three times smaller in size than, for example, in Taurus. We conclude that the observed planetary systems in high-mass open clusters should also be on average smaller than those found around field stars; in particular, planets on wide orbits are expected to be extremely rare in such environments.},

First, the cumulative mass of all objects beyond Neptune (trans-Neptunian objects [TNOs]) is only a fraction of what one would expect. Second, unlike the planets themselves, the TNOs do not orbit on coplanar, circular orbits around the Sun, but move mostly on inclined, eccentric orbits and are distributed in a complex way. This implies that some process restructured the outer solar system after its formation. However, some of the TNOs, referred to as Sednoids, move outside the zone of influence of the planets. Thus, external forces must have played an important part in the restructuring of the outer solar system. The study presented here shows that a close fly-by of a neighboring star can simultaneously lead to the observed lower mass density outside 30 au and excite the TNOs onto eccentric, inclined orbits, including the family of Sednoids. In the past it was estimated that such close fly-bys are rare during the relevant development stage. However, our numerical simulations show that such a scenario is much more likely than previously anticipated. A fly-by also naturally explains the puzzling fact that Neptune has a higher mass than Uranus. Our simulations suggest that many additional Sednoids at high inclinations still await discovery, perhaps including bodies like the postulated planet X.},

Using mid-infrared two-color diagrams ([3.6]-[4.5] vs. [5.8]-[8.0]), we identified 337 class II and 25 class I objects out of 1084 objects detected in all four of these bands with photometric uncertainty better than 10%. Including the 24 μm data, we found 213 class II and 20 class I sources out of 279 stars also detected at this latter band. The center of the class II density contours is in very good agreement with the center of the cluster detected in the 2MASS images. We studied the distribution of the class II sources relative to the O stars and found that the effect of high-mass stars on the circumstellar disks is significant only in their immediate vicinity.},

  abstract = {Context: The observation of young stars with circumstellar disks 
suggests that the disks are dissipated, starting from the inner region,
by the radiation of the central star and eventually by the formation of
rocky planetesimals, over a time scale of several million years. It was
also shown that strong UV radiation emitted by nearby massive stars can
heat a circumstellar disk up to some thousand degrees, inducing the
photoevaporation of the gas. This process strongly reduces the
dissipation time scale. Aims: We study whether there exists a
correlation between the spatial distribution of stars with circumstellar
disks and the position of massive stars with spectral class earlier than
B5, in the open cluster NGC 6611. Methods: We created a multiband
catalog of the cluster, down to V˜ 23^m, using optical data from a
WFI observation at 2.2 m of ESO in the BVI bands, the 2MASS public point
source catalog and an archival X-ray observation made with CHANDRA/ACIS.
We selected the stars with infrared excess (due to the emission of a
circumstellar disk) using suitable color indices independent of
extinction, and studied their spatial distribution. Results: The
spatial distribution of the stars with K band excess (due to the
presence of a circumstellar disk) is anti correlated with that of the
massive stars: the disks are more frequent at large distances from these
stars. We argue that this is in agreement with the hypothesis that the
circumstellar disks are heated by the UV radiation from the massive
stars and photoevaporated.

clear proof of the role of externally induced photoevaporation in the

for study of disk photoevaporation, due to its significant population of
massive members and stars with disk. In a previous paper, we obtained
evidence of the influence of the strong UV field generated by the
massive cluster members on the evolution of disks around low-mass
Pre-Main Sequence members. Our study was based on a multiband BVIJHK and

the evolution of disks in NGC 6611. Methods: In a field of view
of 33'×34' centered on the cluster, we select the candidate
members with disks of NGC 6611 using IRAC color-color diagrams and
suitable reddening-free color indices. Using the X-ray data to select
Class III cluster members, we also estimate disks frequency relative to
the intensity of the incident radiation emitted by massive members. Results: We identify 458 candidate members with circumstellar disks,
among which 146 had not been discovered previously. By comparing all
color indices used to select cluster members with disk, we claim that
these indices measure the excess of radiation due to the emission of the
same physical region of the disk (i.e. the inner rim at the dust
sublimation radius). Our new results confirm that UV radiation from
massive stars affects the evolution of nearby circumstellar disks.

  doi = {10.1086/307055},
  abstract = {We have modeled the neutral flows emerging from circumstellar disks or small clumps of size r<SUB>0</SUB> illuminated by an external source of ultraviolet radiation. The models are applied to the disks (proplyds) in the Orion Nebula, most of which are illuminated by θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori. Our models improve upon the simpler models of Johnstone, Hollenbach, &amp; Ballyby including the results of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium photodissociation region (PDR) codes, and by treating the flow speed off the disk surface in a more consistent manner. We present a study that delineates the parameter space (G<SUB>0</SUB>, r<SUB>0</SUB>, and σ<SUB>ext</SUB>) in which far-ultraviolet (FUV)-dominated, as opposed to extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)-dominated, flows exist. G<SUB>0</SUB> is the FUV (6 eV&lt;hν&lt;13.6 eV) flux (in units of the local average interstellar flux) incident on the neutral flow at the ionization front (IF), and σ<SUB>ext</SUB> is the dust FUV extinction cross section per H nucleus in the flow region. FUV-dominated flows are extended with sizes of the IF r<SUB>IF</SUB>&gt;~2r<SUB>0</SUB>, have a shock between the disk surface and IF, and the mass-loss rates are determined by FUV photons. For σ<SUB>ext</SUB>=8×10<SUP>-22</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP> and a UV source similar to θ<SUP>1</SUP> C Ori, the FUV-dominated region extends from G<SUB>0</SUB>~5×10<SUP>4</SUP> to G<SUB>0</SUB>~2×10<SUP>7</SUP> (or distances from θ<SUP>1</SUP> C Ori of 0.3-0.01 pc), for disk or clump size of r<SUB>0</SUB>~10<SUP>14</SUP>-10<SUP>15</SUP> cm. Outside this parameter space, hydrogen-ionizing EUV photons dominate the photoevaporation, and the IF is close to the disk surface (r<SUB>IF</SUB>&lt;~2r<SUB>0</SUB>). We show that FUV-dominated flows can explain the observed sizes of the ionization fronts around many of the photoevaporating disks in Orion. The size of the neutral flow region, r<SUB>IF</SUB>, depends mainly on r<SUB>0</SUB>, G<SUB>0</SUB>, and σ<SUB>ext</SUB> inside the flow region. Using ten objects in Orion for which both r<SUB>0</SUB> and r<SUB>IF</SUB> are directly observed, and for which G<SUB>0</SUB> can be estimated from the observed projected distance of the proplyd from θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori, we find that σ<SUB>ext</SUB>~8×10<SUP>-22</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP> best fits the observations. In these models, the disk mass-loss rates are roughly 10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. We have determined the disk masses for circular and radial proplyd orbits. For circular orbits around θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori, the disk masses range between 0.005 and 0.04 (t<SUB>i</SUB>/10<SUP>5</SUP> yr) M<SUB>solar</SUB>, where t<SUB>i</SUB> is the illumination timescale. Comparison with millimeter observations of the disk masses (&lt;~0.02 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) indicate t<SUB>i</SUB>~10<SUP>5</SUP> yr, suggesting that θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori is a young (&lt;~10<SUP>5</SUP> yr old) O star in this scenario. The timescale for the disks to significantly lose mass and shrink is ~10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. If the disks cross the Trapezium cluster on radial orbits, the proplyd masses range between 0.002 and 0.01 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. For radial orbits, the lifetime of the proplyds can be as large as the age of the Orion Cluster (~1 Myr), and θ<SUP>1</SUP>C Ori can be significantly older than 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. We have calculated the thermal and chemical structure of the flow region in the observationally best studied object HST 182-413 (HST 10) and the representative object HST 155-338. A region of atomic hydrogen extends from the IF toward the disk surface, but close to the surface hydrogen becomes molecular. The temperatures inside the atomic layer are several thousand K. We have calculated the H<SUB>2</SUB> 1-0 S(1) and the H<SUB>2</SUB> 2-1 S(1) vibrational line intensities, the [C II] 158 μm and [O I] 63 μm fine-structure line intensities, and the [O I] 6300 Å line intensity. We find good agreement between the observed H<SUB>2</SUB> 1-0 S(1) line intensity and the theoretically predicted one. The models can also reproduce the [O I] 6300 Å line emission observed close to the disk surface in HST 182-413, HST 155-338, and the other proplyds where the disks can be resolved in the [O I] line. The other lines are not yet observed; we present them here as predictions for future observations.},

Here we investigate the kinematic signatures in disks produced by multi-Jupiter mass ($M_{\rm J}$) planets using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations. Such a planet opens a deep gap, and drives transonic vertical motions inside. Such motions include both a bulk motion of the entire half-disk column, and turbulence on scales comparable to and smaller than the scale height. They significantly broaden molecular lines from the gap, producing double-peaked line profiles at certain locations, and a kinematic velocity dispersion comparable to thermal after azimuthal averaging. The same planet does not drive fast vertical motions outside the gap, except at the inner spiral arms and the disk surface. Searching for line broadening induced by multi-$M_{\rm J}$ planets inside gaps requires an angular resolution comparable to the gap width, an assessment of the gap gas temperature to within a factor of 2, and a high sensitivity needed to detect line emission from the gap.},

  abstract = {We explore ultraviolet switch models for the dispersal of circumstellar discs in T Tauri stars that involve both photoevaporation by the central star and viscous evolution. We show that in combination these processes generate the observed `two-time-scale' behaviour for the dispersal of such discs, whereby the disc is rapidly dispersed at the end of its life on a time-scale that is a small fraction of the disc lifetime. This switch is activated when the accretion rate through the disc declines to a low level (a few times 10<SUP>-10</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP>) such that it roughly matches the rate of photoevaporative mass loss from the disc outside 5-10au. At this point, the inner disc is deprived of further replenishment from larger radii and empties on to the central star on its own short viscous time-scale. This causes the rapid (~10<SUP>5</SUP>-yr) decline in accretion rate on to the central star and in all disc-related emission shortward of 10μm. We discuss the implications of this model for the detection of millimetre emission around weak-line T Tauri stars, and also point out the consequences of such a sudden draining for planet formation in the inner regions of circumstellar discs.},

Comparison with Keplerian models indicates that the RW Aur A disk is the smallest detected so far around a T Tauri star (radius 40-57 AU) and that the CO emitting layer at the outer edge is warmer than the dust ( K) and relatively thick (). The morphology and kinematics of the detected features strongly suggest that we are witnessing tidal stripping of the primary disk by the recent fly-by of RW Aur B. We speculate that tidal dissipation might explain the warmer gas temperatures in the RW Aur A disk compared with typical T Tauri stars, and perhaps play a role in its elevated accretion rate. We also find that the rotation sense of the RW Aur A disk is opposite to transverse velocity shifts in the optical jet reported by Woitas et al. (2005, A&A, 432, 149). We argue that these transverse shifts are likely to represent only upper limits to the true jet rotation speed. The limits remain consistent with current models of MHD launching from the disk.},

  abstract = {Context. One mechanism for the external destruction of protoplanetary discs in young dense clusters is tidal disruption during the flyby of another cluster member. The degree of mass loss in such an encounter depends, among other parameters, on the distribution of the material within the disc. Previous work showed that this is especially so in encounters that truncate large parts of the outer disc. The expectation is that the number of completely destroyed discs in a cluster also depends on the mass distribution within the discs. <BR /> Aims: Here we test this hypothesis by determining the influence of encounters on the disc fraction and average disc mass in clusters of various stellar densities for different mass distributions in the discs. <BR /> Methods: This is done by performing nbody6simulations of a variety of cluster environments, where we track the encounter dynamics and determine the mass loss due to these encounters for different disc-mass distributions. <BR /> Results: We find that although the disc-mass distribution has a significant impact on the disc losses for specific star-disc encounters, the overall disc frequency generally remains unaffected. The reason is that in single encounters the dependence on the mass distribution is strongest if both stars have very different masses. Such encounters are rather infrequent in sparse clusters. In dense clusters these encounters are more common; however, here the disc frequency is largely determined by encounters between low-mass stars such that the overall disc frequency does not change significantly. <BR /> Conclusions: For tidal disruption the disc destruction in clusters is fairly independent of the actual distribution of the material in the disc. The all determining factor remains the cluster density.},

  abstract = {We explore how measurements of protoplanetary disc masses and accretion rates provided by surveys of star-forming regions can be analysed via the dimensionless accretion parameter, which we define as the product of the accretion rate and stellar age divided by the disc mass. By extending and generalizing the study of Jones et al., we demonstrate that this parameter should be less than or of order unity for a wide range of evolutionary scenarios, rising above unity only during the final stages of outside-in clearing by external photoevaporation. We use this result to assess the reliability of disc mass estimates derived from CO isotopologues and sub-mm continuum emission by examining the distribution of accretion efficiencies in regions that are not subject to external photoevaporation. We find that while dust-based mass estimates produce results compatible with theoretical expectations assuming a canonical dust-to-gas ratio, the systematically lower CO-based estimates yield accretion efficiencies significantly above unity in contrast with the theory. This finding provides additional evidence that CO-based disc masses are an underestimate, in line with arguments that have been made on the basis of chemical modelling of relatively small samples. On the other hand, we demonstrate that dust-based mass estimates are sufficiently accurate to reveal distinctly higher accretion efficiencies in the Trapezium cluster, where this result is expected, given the evident importance of external photoevaporation. We therefore propose the dimensionless accretion parameter as a new diagnostic of external photoevaporation in other star-forming regions.},

  abstract = {Most stars do not form in isolation, but as part of a star cluster or association. These young stars are initially surrounded by protoplanetary discs. In these cluster environments tidal interactions with other cluster members can alter the disc properties. Besides the disc frequency, its mass, angular momentum, and energy, the disc's size is particularly prone to being changed by a passing star. So far the change in disc size has only been investigated for a small number of very specific encounters. Several studies investigated the effect of the cluster environment on the sizes of planetary systems like our own solar system, based on a generalisation of information from this limited sample. We performed numerical simulations covering the wide parameter space typical of young star clusters, to test the validity of this approach. Here the sizes of discs after encounters are presented, based on a size definition that is comparable to the one used in observational studies. We find that, except for encounters between equal-mass stars, the usually applied estimates are insufficient. They tend to severely overestimate the remaining disc size. We show that the disc size after an encounter can be described by a relatively simple dependence on the periastron distance and the mass ratio of the encounter partners. This knowledge allows us, for example, to pin down the types of encounter possibly responsible for the structure of today's solar system.

  abstract = {Star cluster complexes such as the Carina Nebula can have formed in turbulent giant molecular clouds. We perform a series of $N$-body simulations starting from subclustering initial conditions based on hydrodynamic simulations of turbulent molecular clouds. These simulations finally result in the formation of star cluster complexes consisting of several subclusters (clumps). We obtain the inter-clump velocity distribution, the size of the region, and the mass of the most massive cluster in our simulated complex and compare the results with observed ones (the Carina Nebula and NGC 2264). The one-dimensional inter-clump velocity dispersion obtained from our simulations is $2.9\pm0.3$ and $1.4\pm0.4$ km s$^{-1}$ for the Carina- and NGC 2264-like models, respectively, which are consistent with those obtained from Gaia Data Release 2: 2.35 and 0.99 km s$^{-1}$ for the Carina Nebula and NGC 2264, respectively. We estimate that the masses of the parental molecular clouds for the Carina Nebula and the NGC 2264 are $4\times 10^5$ and $4\times 10^4M_{\odot}$, respectively.},

We quantify the amount of mass segregation using $\Lambda_{\rm MSR}$ and find that the most massive cores are mildly mass segregated in NGC2068/NGC2071 ($\Lambda_{\rm MSR} \sim 2$), and very mass segregated in NGC2023/NGC2024 ($\Lambda_{\rm MSR} = 28^{+13}_{-10}$ for the four most massive cores). Whereas the most massive cores in L1622 are not in areas of relatively high surface density, or deeper gravitational potentials, the massive cores in NGC2068/NGC2071 and NGC2023/NGC2024 are significantly so. Given the low density (10 cores pc$^{-2}$) and spatial substructure of cores in Orion B, the mass segregation cannot be dynamical. Our results are also inconsistent with simulations in which the most massive stars form via competitive accretion, and instead hint that magnetic fields may be important in influencing the primordial spatial distributions of gas and stars in star-forming regions.},

We find that the Σ distribution is degenerate, in the sense that many different cluster morphologies (smooth or substructured) produce similar cumulative distributions. However, when used in tandem with a measure of structure, such as the Q-parameter, the current spatial and dynamical state of a star cluster can be inferred. The effect of cluster dynamics on the Σ distribution and the Q-parameter is investigated using N-body simulations and we find that, depending on the assumed initial conditions, the Σ distribution can rapidly evolve from high to low densities in less than 5 Myr. This suggests that the Σ distribution can only be used to assess the current density of a star-forming region, and provides little information on its initial density. However, if the Σ distribution is used together with the Q-parameter, then information on the amount of substructure can be used as a proxy to infer the amount of dynamical evolution that has taken place. Substructure is erased quickly through dynamics, which can disrupt binary star systems and planets, as well as facilitate dynamical mass segregation. Therefore, dynamical processing in young star-forming regions could still be significant, even without currently observed high densities.},

  abstract = {The analysis of the distribution of stars in open clusters may yield important information on the star formation process and early dynamical evolution of stellar clusters. Here we address this issue by systematically characterizing the internal spatial structure of 16 open clusters in the Milky Way spanning a wide range of ages. Cluster stars have been selected from a membership probability analysis based on a nonparametric method that uses both positions and proper motions and does not make any a priori assumption on the underlying distributions. The internal structure is then characterized by means of the minimum spanning tree method (Q parameter), King profile fitting, and the correlation dimension (D<SUB>c</SUB> ) for those clusters with fractal patterns. On average, clusters with fractal-like structure are younger than those exhibiting radial star density profiles and an apparent trend between Q and age is observed in agreement with previous ideas about the dynamical evolution of the internal spatial structure of stellar clusters. However, some new results are obtained from a more detailed analysis: (1) a clear correlation between Q and the concentration parameter of the King model for those cluster with radial density profiles, (2) the presence of spatial substructure in clusters as old as ~100 Myr, and (3) a significant correlation between fractal dimension and age for those clusters with internal substructure. Moreover, the lowest fractal dimensions seem to be considerably smaller than the average value measured in galactic molecular cloud complexes.},

We find that the minimum spanning tree method reflects more the compactness, which represents the global spatial distribution of massive stars, while the local stellar density method reflects more the crowdedness, which provides the local gravitational potential information. It is suggested to measure the local and the global mass segregation simultaneously. We also develop a hybrid method that takes both aspects into account. This hybrid method balances the local and the global mass segregation in the sense that the predominant one is either caused by dynamical evolution or purely accidental, especially when such information is unknown a priori. In addition, we test our prescriptions with numerical models and show the impact of binaries in estimating the mass segregation value. As an application, we use these methods on the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) observations and the Taurus cluster. We find that the ONC is significantly mass segregated down to the 20th most massive stars. In contrast, the massive stars of the Taurus cluster are sparsely distributed in many different subclusters, showing a low degree of compactness. The massive stars of Taurus are also found to be distributed in the high-density region of the subclusters, showing significant mass segregation at subcluster scales. Meanwhile, we also apply these methods to discuss the possible mechanisms of the dynamical evolution of the simulated substructured star clusters.},

We present a new algorithm for statistically analysing the distribution of stars to quantify the level of substructure. We suggest that, even at the simplest level, the internal structure of a fractal cluster requires the specification of three parameters. (I) The 3D fractal dimension, D, measures the extent to which the clusters on one level of the nested hierarchy fill the volume of their parent cluster. (II) The number of levels, L, reflects the finite ratio between the linear size of the large root-cluster at the top of the hierarchy, and the smallest leaf-clusters at the bottom of the hierarchy. (III) The volume-density scaling exponent, C = -d ln [δ n]/d ln [L] measures the factor by which the excess density, δn, in a structure of scale L, exceeds that of the background formed by larger structures; it is similar, but not exactly equivalent, to the exponent in Larson's scaling relation between density and size for molecular clouds. We describe an algorithm that can be used to constrain the values of (D,L,C) and apply this method to artificial and observed clusters. We show that this algorithm is able to reliably describe the three-dimensional structure of an artificial star cluster from the two-dimensional projection, and quantify the varied structures observed in real and simulated clusters.},

We follow the evolution of the regions' substructure using the Q-parameter, we search for dynamical mass segregation using the Lambda_MSR technique, and we also quantify the evolution of local density around stars as a function of mass using the Sigma_LDR method. The amount of dynamical mass segregation measured by Lambda_MSR is generally only significant for subvirial and virialised, substructured regions - which usually evolve to form bound clusters. The Sigma_LDR method shows that massive stars attain higher local densities than the median value in all regions, even those that are supervirial and evolve to form (unbound) associations. We also introduce the Q-Sigma_LDR plot, which describes the evolution of spatial structure as a function of mass-weighted local density in a star forming region. Initially dense (>1000 stars pc^{-2}), bound regions always have Q >1, Sigma_LDR > 2 after 5Myr, whereas dense unbound regions always have Q < 1, Sigma_LDR > 2 after 5Myr. Less dense regions (<100 stars pc^{-2}) do not usually exhibit Sigma_LDR > 2 values, and if relatively high local density around massive stars arises purely from dynamics, then the Q-Sigma_LDR plot can be used to estimate the initial density of a star forming region.},

We find that in regions that are initially subvirial, or in global virial equilibrium but subvirial on local scales, the system relaxes to virial equilibrium within several million years, or roughly 25-50 crossing times, according to the measured virial ratio. However, the measured velocity dispersion, σ, appears to be a bad diagnostic of the current virial state of these systems as it suggests that they become supervirial when compared to the velocity dispersion estimated from the virial mass, σ<SUB>vir</SUB>. We suggest that this discrepancy is caused by the fact that the regions are never fully relaxed, and that the early non-equilibrium evolution is imprinted in the one-dimensional velocity dispersion at these early epochs. If measured early enough (&lt;2 Myr in our simulations, or ̃20 crossing times), the velocity dispersion can be used to determine whether a region was highly supervirial at birth without the risk of degeneracy. We show that combining σ, or the ratio of σ to the interquartile range (IQR) dispersion, with measures of spatial structure, places stronger constraints on the dynamical history of a region than using the velocity dispersion in isolation.},

  abstract = {Context. Investigations of mass segregation are of vital interest for the understanding of the formation and dynamical evolution of stellar systems on a wide range of spatial scales. A consistent analysis requires a robust measure among different objects and well-defined comparison with theoretical expectations. Various methods have been used for this purpose but usually with limited significance, quantifiability, and application to both simulations and observations. <BR /> Aims: We aim at developing a measure of mass segregation with as few parameters as possible, robustness against peculiar configurations, independence of mass determination, simple implementation, stable algorithm, and that is equally well adoptable for data from either simulations or observations. <BR /> Methods: Our method is based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) that serves as a geometry-independent measure of concentration. Compared to previous such approaches we obtain a significant refinement by using the geometrical mean as an intermediate-pass. <BR /> Results: The geometrical mean boosts the sensitivity compared to previous applications of the MST. It thus allows the detection of mass segregation with much higher confidence and for much lower degrees of mass segregation than other approaches. The method shows in particular very clear signatures even when applied to small subsets of the entire population. We confirm with high significance strong mass segregation of the five most massive stars in the Orion nebula cluster (ONC). <BR /> Conclusions: Our method is the most sensitive general measure of mass segregation so far and provides robust results for both data from simulations and observations. As such it is ideally suited for tracking mass segregation in young star clusters and to investigate the long standing paradigm of primordial mass segregation by comparison of simulations and observations.},

All four methods have been proposed in the literature as techniques for quantifying mass segregation, yet they routinely produce contradictory results as they do not all measure the same thing. We apply each method to synthetic star-forming regions to determine when and why they have shortcomings. When a star-forming region is smooth and centrally concentrated, all four methods correctly identify mass segregation when it is present. However, if the region is spatially substructured, the $\Omega_{\rm GSR}$ method fails because it arbitrarily defines groups in the hierarchical distribution, and usually discards positional information for many of the most massive stars in the region. We also show that the $\Lambda_{\rm MSR}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm LDR}$ methods can sometimes produce apparently contradictory results, because they use different definitions of mass segregation. We conclude that only $\Lambda_{\rm MSR}$ measures mass segregation in the classical sense (without the need for defining the centre of the region), although $\Sigma_{\rm LDR}$ does place limits on the amount of previous dynamical evolution in a star-forming region.},

Gas and dust structures induced by the ﬂyby differ because of drag-induced effects on the dust grains. Variations in the accretion rate by up to an order of magnitude occur over a time-scale of order 10 years or less, inducing FU Orionis-like outbursts. The remnant discs are truncated and warped.

  abstract = {High energy radiation from a planet host star can have strong influence on the final habitability of a system through several mechanisms. In this context we have constructed a catalogue containing the X-ray luminosities, as well as basic stellar and planetary properties of all known stars hosting giant planets (> 0.1 Mjup) that have been observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM-Newton and/or ROSAT. Specifically in this paper we present a first application of this catalogue to search for a possible imprint of X-ray photoevaporation of planet-forming discs on the present-day orbital distribution of the observed giant planets. We found a suggestive void in the semi-major axis, a, versus X-ray luminosity, Lx, plane, roughly located between a ~ 0.05-1 au and Lx ~10^27-10^29 erg/s, which would be expected if photoevaporation played a dominant role in the migration history of these systems. However, due to the small observational sample size, the statistical significance of this feature cannot be proven at this point.},

COCOA is used to synthetically observe these different GC models with optical telescopes, perform point spread function photometry, and subsequently produce observed colour-magnitude diagrams. We also use COCOA to compare the results from synthetic observations of a cluster model that has the same age and metallicity as the Galactic GC NGC 2808 with observations of the same cluster carried out with a 2.2 m optical telescope. We find that COCOA can effectively simulate realistic observations and recover photometric data. COCOA has numerous scientific applications that maybe be helpful for both theoreticians and observers that work on star clusters.

  volume = {340},
  abstract = {By means of numerical simulations we investigate the photoevaporation of protostellar disks. Here we concentrate on the evolution of disks under the influence of an external Lyman continuum radiation field. The morphological evolution is illustrated in detail for the case of a relatively massive disk exposed to a modest ionizing flux. Cometary tails develop and break off into filaments which leave the immediate vicinity of the disk with the evaporating flow. It evolves into a relatively undisturbed disk completely enveloped by the ionization front. A low mass star-disk system is used to investigate the dependence of the evolution on the distance from the ionizing source. Distances and external Euv flux are adapted to the situation of the proplyds close to the Trapezium star theta (1) Ori C. The low-mass system becomes extremely deformed through the asymmetrical illumination. The total mass of the disk fragments which break off during the cometary phase ( ~ 2*E(4) yr) is of order 10% of the disk mass. With decreasing distance the densest parts of the disk remnant are more strongly disturbed. The dependence of the final photoevaporation rate on the distance dot {M}_ph~ d(-1.1) is consistent with analytical models. For comparison with observations we use a 3D ray-tracing procedure to calculate spectra, continuum maps and Hα line profiles. During the cometary phase the elongated tails of the low mass system are recognizable at almost all frequencies ranging from the radio region to the near-infrared. Furthermore, the disk remnants viewed face-on from the direction of the source appear as round heads in Hα resembling this class of proplyds quite well.},

  abstract = {During the last decades, a great interest has emerged to know if even the most massive stars in our galaxy (namely the spectral O-type stars) are formed in a similar manner as the low- and intermediate-mass stars, that is, through the presence of accreting disks and powerful outflows. Here, using sensitive observations of the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), we report a resolved Keplerian disk (with fifteen synthesized beams across its major axis) surrounding the deeply embedded O-type protostar IRAS16547$-$4247. The disk shows some asymmetries that could arise because of the disk is unstable and fragmenting or maybe because of different excitation conditions within the disk. The enclosed mass estimated from the disk Keplerian radial velocities is 25$\pm$3 M$_\odot$. The molecular disk is at the base of an ionized thermal radio jet and is approximately perpendicular to the jet axis orientation. We additionally find the existence of a binary system of compact dusty objects at the center of the accreting disk, which indicates the possible formation of an O-type star and a companion of lower mass. This is not surprising due to the high binary fraction reported in massive stars. Subtracting the contribution of the dusty disk plus the envelope and the companion, we estimated a mass of 20 M$_\odot$ for the central star.},

  shorttitle = {Clustering clusters},
  abstract = {Globular Clusters (GCs) have historically been subdivided in either two (disk/halo) or three (disk/inner-halo/outer-halo) groups based on their orbital, chemical and internal physical properties. The qualitative nature of this subdivision makes it impossible to determine whether the natural number of groups is actually two, three, or more. In this paper we use cluster analysis on the $(\log M, \log \sigma_0, \log R_e, [Fe/H], \log | Z |)$ space to show that the intrinsic number of GC groups is actually either $k=2$ or $k=3$, with the latter being favored albeit non-significantly. In the $k=2$ case, the Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering algorithm recovers a metal-poor halo GC group and a metal-rich disk GC group. With $k=3$ the three groups can be interpreted as disk/inner-halo/outer-halo families. For each group we obtain a medoid, i.e. a representative element (NGC $6352$, NGC $5986$, and NGC $5466$ for the disk, inner halo, and outer halo respectively), and a measure of how strongly each GC is associated to its group, the so-called silhouette width. Using the latter, we find a correlation with age for both disk and outer halo GCs where the stronger the association of a GC with the disk (outer halo) group, the younger (older) it is.},

The process of protoplanetary disk formation can result in initial misalignments, where the disk orbital plane is different from the stellar equator in single-star systems, or different from the binary orbital plane in systems with two stars2. A quirk of the dynamics means that initially misaligned ‘circumbinary’ disks—those that surround two stars—are predicted to evolve to one of two possible stable configurations: one where the disk and binary orbital planes are coplanar and one where they are perpendicular (a ‘polar’ configuration)3–5. Previous work has found coplanar circumbinary disks6, but no polar examples were known until now. Here, we report the first discovery of a protoplanetary circumbinary disk in the polar configuration, supporting the predictions that such disks should exist. The disk shows some characteristics that are similar to disks around single stars, and that are attributed to dust growth. Thus, the first stages of planet formation appear able to proceed in polar circumbinary disks.},

One possible explanation for these observations is a disc warp, which could be induced by a planet on a misaligned orbit. We present three-dimensional numerical simulations of the tidal interaction between a protoplanetary disc and a misaligned planet. For low planet masses we show that our simulations accurately model the evolution of inclined planet orbit (up to moderate inclinations). For a planet massive enough to carve a gap, the disc is separated into two components and the gas interior and exterior to the planet orbit evolve separately, forming an inner and outer disc. Due to the inclination of the planet, a warp develops across the planet orbit such that there is a relative tilt and twist between these discs. We show that when other parameters are held constant, the relative inclination that develops between the inner and outer disc depends on the outer radius of the total disc modelled. For a given disc mass, our results suggest that the observational relevance of the warp depends more strongly on the mass of the planet rather than the inclination of the orbit.},

  abstract = {The presence of gaseous giant planets whose orbits lie in extreme proximity to their host stars ("hot Jupiters"), can largely be accounted for by planetary migration, associated with viscous evolution of proto-planetary nebulae. Recently, observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during planetary transits have revealed that a considerable fraction of detected hot Jupiters reside on orbits that are misaligned with respect to the spin-axes of their host stars. This observational fact has cast significant doubts on the importance of disk-driven migration as a mechanism for production of hot Jupiters, thereby reestablishing the origins of close-in planetary orbits as an open question. Here we show that misaligned orbits can be a natural consequence of disk migration. Our argument rests on an enhanced abundance of binary stellar companions in star formation environments, whose orbital plane is uncorrelated with the spin axes of the individual stars. We analyze the dynamical evolution of idealized proto-planetary disks under perturbations from massive distant bodies and demonstrate that the resulting gravitational torques act to misalign the orbital planes of the disks relative to the spin poles of their host stars. As a result, we predict that in the absence of strong disk-host star angular momentum coupling or sufficient dissipation that acts to realign the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbits, the fraction of planetary systems (including systems of hot Neptunes and Super-Earths), whose angular momentum vectors are misaligned with respect to their host-stars should be commensurate with the rate of primordial stellar multiplicity.},

They are evolved using collisional stellar dynamics and include mass loss due to stellar evolution. After studying and understanding that the differences between AMUSE results and results from previous studies are understood, we explored the variation in cluster lifetimes due to the random realization noise introduced by transforming a King model to specific initial conditions. This random realization noise can affect the lifetime of a simulated star cluster by up to 30%. Two modes of star cluster dissolution were identified: a mass evolution curve that contains a runaway cluster dissolution with a sudden loss of mass, and a dissolution mode that does not contain this feature. We refer to these dissolution modes as "dynamical" and "relaxation" dominated, respectively. For Salpeter-like initial mass functions, we determined the boundary between these two modes in terms of the dynamical and relaxation timescales.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disks are found around young stars, and represent the embryonic stage of planetary systems. At different phases of their evolution, disks may undergo substantial mass-loss by photoevaporation: energetic photons from the central or a nearby star heat the disk, hence particles can escape the gravitational potential and the disk loses mass. However, this mechanism, and the underlying physics regulating photoevaporation, have not been well constrained by observations so far. The aims of this thesis are to study photoevaporation, in the specific case when it is driven by far-UV photons, to identify the main physical parameters (density, temperature) and processes (gas heating and cooling mechanisms) that are involved, and to estimate its impact on the disk dynamical evolution. The study relies on coupling observations and models of disks being photoevaporated by UV photons coming from neighbouring massive star(s).},

  abstract = {Context: The complex system HD 100453 AB with a ring-like circumprimary disk and two spiral arms, one of which is pointing to the secondary, is a good laboratory to test spiral formation theories. Aims: To quantify the interaction of HD 100453 B with the circumprimary disk. Methods: Using ALMA band 6 dust continuum and CO isotopologue observations we study the HD 100453 AB system with a spatial resolution of 0.09" x 0.17" at 234 GHz. We use SPH simulations and orbital fitting to investigate the tidal influence of the companion on the disk. Results: We resolve the continuum emission around HD 100453 A into a disk between 0.22" and 0.40" with an inclination of 29.5 deg. and a position angle of 151.0 deg., an unresolved inner disk, and excess mm emission cospatial with the northern spiral arm which was previously detected using scattered light observations. We also detect CO emission from 7 au (well within the disk cavity) out to 1.10", i.e., overlapping with HD 100453 B at least in projection. The outer CO disk PA and inclination differ by up to 10 deg. from the values found for the inner CO disk and the dust continuum emission, which we interpret as due to gravitational interaction with HD 100453 B. Both the spatial extent of the CO disk and the detection of mm emission at the same location as the northern spiral arm are in disagreement with the previously proposed near co-planar orbit of HD 100453 B. Conclusions: We conclude that HD 100453 B has an orbit that is significantly misaligned with the circumprimary disk. Because it is unclear whether such an orbit can explain the observed system geometry we highlight an alternative scenario that explains all detected disk features where another, (yet) undetected, low mass close companion within the disk cavity, shepherds a misaligned inner disk whose slowly precessing shadows excite the spiral arms.},

We explored the parameter space of the encounters, varying the mass ratio of the two stars, their pericentre and eccentricity of the encounter, and its geometry. We find that particles are transferred to the other star from a restricted radial range in the disc and the limiting radii of this transfer region depend on the parameters of the encounter. We derive an approximate analytic description of the inner radius of the region. The efficiency of the mass transfer generally decreases with increasing encounter pericentre and increasing mass of the star initially possessing the disc. Depending on the parameters of the encounter, the transfer particles have a specific distribution in the space of orbital elements (semimajor axis, eccentricity, inclination, and argument of pericentre) around their new host star. The population of the transferred particles can be used to constrain the encounter through which it was delivered. We expect that many stars experienced transfer among their debris discs and planetary systems in their birth environment. This mechanism presents a formation channel for objects on wide orbits of arbitrary inclinations, typically having high eccentricity but possibly also close to circular (eccentricities of about 0.1). Depending on the geometry, such orbital elements can be distinct from those of the objects formed around the star.},

  abstract = {Combining hydrodynamic planet-disk interaction simulations with dust evolution models, we show that protoplanetary disks having a giant planet can reveal diverse morphology in (sub-)millimeter continuum, including a full disk without significant radial structure, a transition disk with an inner cavity, a disk with a single gap and a central continuum peak, and a disk with multiple rings and gaps. Such a diversity originates from (1) the level of viscous transport in the disk which determines the number of gaps a planet can open; (2) the size and spatial distributions of grains determined by the coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift, which in turn affects the emmisivity of the disk at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths; and (3) the angular resolution used to observe the disk. In particular, our results show that disks having the same underlying gas distribution can have very different grain size/spatial distributions and thus appearance in continuum, depending on the interplay among coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift. This suggests that proper treatments for the grain growth have to be included in models of protoplanetary disks concerning continuum properties and that complementary molecular line observations are highly desired in addition to continuum observations to reveal the true nature of disks. The fact that a single planet can produce diverse disk morphology emphasizes the need to search for more direct, localized signatures of planets in order to confirm (or dispute) the planetary origin of observed ringed substructures.},

  abstract = {Protoplanetary disk simulations show that a single planet can excite more than one spiral arm, possibly explaining recent observations of multiple spiral arms in some systems. In this paper, we explain the mechanism by which a planet excites multiple spiral arms in a protoplanetary disk. Contrary to previous speculations, the formation of both primary and additional arms can be understood as a linear process when the planet mass is sufficiently small. A planet resonantly interacts with epicyclic oscillations in the disk, launching spiral wave modes around the Lindblad resonances. When a set of wave modes is in phase, they can constructively interfere with each other and create a spiral arm. More than one spiral arm can form because such constructive interference can occur for different sets of wave modes, with the exact number and launching position of spiral arms dependent on the planet mass as well as the disk temperature profile. Non-linear effects become increasingly important as the planet mass increases, resulting in spiral arms with stronger shocks and thus larger pitch angles. This is found in common for both primary and additional arms. When a planet has a sufficiently large mass ($\gtrsim$ 3 thermal masses for $(h/r)_p=0.1$), only two spiral arms form interior to its orbit. The wave modes that would form a tertiary arm for smaller mass planets merge with the primary arm. Improvements in our understanding of the formation of spiral arms can provide crucial insights into the origin of observed spiral arms in protoplanetary disks.},

  abstract = {We analyse N-body simulations of star-forming regions to investigate the effects of external far and extreme ultra-violet photoevaporation from massive stars on protoplanetary discs. By varying the initial conditions of simulated star-forming regions, such as the spatial distribution, net bulk motion (virial ratio), and density, we investigate which parameters most affect the rate at which discs are dispersed due to external photoevaporation. We find that disc dispersal due to external photoevaporation is faster in highly substructured star-forming regions than in smooth and centrally concentrated regions. Sub-virial star-forming regions undergoing collapse also show higher rates of disc dispersal than regions that are in virial equilibrium or are expanding. In moderately dense ($\sim$100 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$) regions, half of all protoplanetary discs with radii $\geq$ 100 AU are photoevaporated within 1 Myr, three times faster than is currently suggested by observational studies. Discs in lower-density star-forming regions ($\sim$10 M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$) survive for longer, but half are still dispersed on short timescales ($\sim$2 Myr). This demonstrates that the initial conditions of the star forming regions will greatly impact the evolution and lifetime of protoplanetary discs. These results also imply that either gas giant planet formation is extremely rapid and occurs before the gas component of discs is evaporated, or gas giants only form in low-density star-forming regions where no massive stars are present to photoevaporate gas from protoplanetary discs.},

The disc masses in IC 348 are significantly lower than those in Taurus (1-3 Myr) and Lupus (1-3 Myr), similar to those of Chamaleon I, (2-3 Myr) and σ Ori (3-5 Myr) and significantly higher than in Upper Scorpiusrpius (5-10 Myr).

  abstract = {We present an investigation into the kinematics of HD 106906 using the newly released Gaia DR2 catalog to search for close encounters with other members of the Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen) association. HD 106906 is an eccentric spectroscopic binary that hosts both a large asymmetric debris disk extending out to at least 500 au and a directly imaged planetary-mass companion at a projected separation of 738 au. The cause of the asymmetry in the debris disk and the unusually wide separation of the planet is not currently known. Using a combination of Gaia DR2 astrometry and ground-based radial velocities, we explore the hypothesis that a close encounter with another cluster member within the last 15 Myr is responsible for the present configuration of the system. Out of 461 stars analyzed, we identified two candidate perturbers that had a median closest approach (CA) distance within 1 pc of HD 106906: HIP 59716 at $D_{\rm CA}=0.65_{-0.40}^{+0.93}$ pc ($t_{\rm CA}=-3.49_{-1.76}^{+0.90}$ Myr) and HIP 59721 at $D_{\rm CA}=0.71_{-0.11}^{+0.18}$ pc ($t_{\rm CA}=-2.18_{-1.04}^{+0.54}$ Myr), with the two stars likely forming a wide physical binary. The trajectories of both stars relative to HD 106906 are almost coplanar with the inner disk ($\Delta\theta = 5.4\pm1.7$ deg and $4.2_{-1.1}^{+0.9}$ deg). These two stars are the best candidates of the currently known members of Sco-Cen for having a dynamically important close encounter with HD 106906, which may have stabilized the orbit of HD 106906 b in the scenario where the planet formed in the inner system and attained high eccentricity by interaction with the central binary.},

Viscous accretion likely dominates disk dispersal in the inner disk (r≤10 AU), whereas photo evaporation is the principal process of disk dispersal outside of r≥10 AU. Disk dispersal timescales are compared and discussed in relation to theoretical estimates for planet formation timescales. Photo evaporation may explain the large differences in the hydrogen content of the giant planets in the solar system.

  abstract = {PDS 70b is the most robustly detected young planet imaged in the gap of a transition disk so far, found at a separation of ~195 mas (~22 au) from its host star and at a position angle of about 155 deg. This system is therefore a unique laboratory to characterize the properties of young planetary systems at the stage of their formation. We aim to trace direct and indirect imprints of PDS 70b on the gas and dust emission of the circumstellar disk in order to study the properties of this ~5 Myr young planetary system. We obtained ALMA band 7 observations of PDS 70 in dust continuum and $^{12}CO$ (3-2) and combined them with archival data resulting in an unprecedented angular resolution of about 70 mas (~8 au). We derive an upper limit on circumplanetary material at the location of PDS 70b of ~0.01 $M_{\oplus}$ and find a highly structured circumstellar disk in both dust and gas. The outer dust ring peaks at ~0.65" (74 au) and reveals a possible second unresolved peak at ~0.53" (60 au). The integrated intensity of CO also shows evidence of a depletion of emission at ~0.2" (23 au) with a width of ~0.1" (11 au). The gas kinematics show evidence of a deviation from Keplerian rotation inside $\lesssim$0.8" (91 au). This implies a pressure gradient that can account for the location of the dust ring well beyond the location of PDS 70b. Further in, we detect an inner disk which appears to be connected to the outer disk by a possible bridge feature in the North-West region in both gas and dust. We compare the observations to hydrodynamical simulations including a planet with different masses covering the estimated mass range previously derived from NIR photometry (~5-9 M$_{Jup}$). We find that even a planet with a mass of 10 M$_{Jup}$ may not be sufficient to explain the extent of the wide gap and an additional low-mass companion may be needed to account for the observed disk morphology.},

These nearby, young stars, most of which are found in loose, comoving groups, provide the opportunity to explore (among many other things) the dissolution of stellar clusters and their diffusion into the field star population. In the age of Gaia, this potential can now be fully exploited. We have identified, and are now investigating, a sample of nearly 400 Galex UV-selected late-type (K and early-M) field stars with Gaia-based distances <120 pc and isochronal ages <=80 Myr (even if binaries). Only a small percentage (<10%) of stars among this (kinematically unbiased) sample can be confidently associated with established nearby, young moving groups (NYMGs). The majority display anomalous kinematics, relative to the known NYMGs. These stars may hence represent a previously unrecognized population of young stars that has recently mixed into the older field star population. We discuss the implications and caveats of such a hypothesis---including the intriguing fact that, in addition to their non-young-star-like kinematics, the majority of the UV-selected, isochronally young field stars within 50 pc appear surprisingly X-ray faint.},

  abstract = {Context. Gas expulsion is a central concept in some of the models for multiple populations and the light-element anti-correlations in globular clusters. If the star formation efficiency was around 30 per cent and the gas expulsion happened on the crossing timescale, this process could preferentially expel stars born with the chemical composition of the proto-cluster gas, while stars with special composition born in the centre would remain bound. Recently, a sample of extragalactic, gas-free, young massive clusters has been identified that has the potential to test the conditions for gas expulsion. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the conditions required for residual gas expulsion on the crossing timescale. We consider a standard initial mass function and different models for the energy production in the cluster: metallicity-dependent stellar winds, radiation, supernovae and more energetic events, such as hypernovae, which are related to gamma ray bursts. The latter may be more energetic than supernovae by up to two orders of magnitude. <BR /> Methods: We computed a large number of thin-shell models for the gas dynamics, and calculated whether the Rayleigh-Taylor instability is able to disrupt the shell before it reaches the escape speed. <BR /> Results: We show that the success of gas expulsion depends on the compactness index of a star cluster C<SUB>5</SUB> ≡ (M<SUB>∗</SUB>/ 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>)/(r<SUB>h</SUB>/ pc), with initial stellar mass M<SUB>∗</SUB> and half-mass radius r<SUB>h</SUB>. For given C<SUB>5</SUB>, a certain critical, local star formation efficiency is required to remove the rest of the gas. Common stellar feedback processes may not lead to gas expulsion with significant loss of stars above C<SUB>5</SUB> ≈ 1. Considering pulsar winds and hypernovae, the limit increases to C<SUB>5</SUB> ≈ 30. If successful, gas expulsion generally takes place on the crossing timescale. Some observed young massive clusters have 1 &lt;C<SUB>5</SUB>&lt; 10 and are gas-free at ≈10 Myr. This suggests that gas expulsion does not affect their stellar mass significantly, unless powerful pulsar winds and hypernovae are common in such objects. By comparison to observations, we show that C<SUB>5</SUB> is a better predictor for the expression of multiple populations than stellar mass. The best separation between star clusters with and without multiple populations is achieved by a stellar winds-based gas expulsion model, where gas expulsion would occur exclusively in star clusters without multiple populations. Single and multiple population clusters also have little overlap in metallicity and age. <BR /> Conclusions: Globular clusters should initially have C<SUB>5</SUB> ≲ 100, if the gas expulsion paradigm was correct. Early gas expulsion, which is suggested by the young massive cluster observations, hence would require special circumstances, and is excluded for several objects. Most likely, the stellar masses did not change significantly at the removal of the primordial gas. Instead, the predictive power of the C<SUB>5</SUB> index for the expression of multiple populations is consistent with the idea that gas expulsion may prevent the expression of multiple populations. On this basis, compact young massive clusters should also have multiple populations.},

  shorttitle = {External photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs in Cygnus OB2},
  abstract = {Many stars form in regions of enhanced stellar density, wherein the influence of stellar neighbours can have a strong influence on a protoplanetary disc (PPD) population. In particular, far ultraviolet (FUV) flux from massive stars drives thermal winds from the outer edge of PPDs, accelerating disc destruction. In this work, we present a novel technique for constraining the dynamical history of a star forming environment using PPD properties in a strongly FUV irradiated environment. Applying recent models for FUV induced mass loss rates to the PPD population of Cygnus OB2, we constrain how long ago primordial gas was expelled from the region; $ 0.5$ Myr ago if the Shakura & Sunyaev $\alpha$-viscosity parameter is $\alpha = 10^{-2}$ (corresponding to a viscous timescale of $\tau_\mathrm{visc} \approx 0.5$ Myr for a disc of scale radius $40$ au around a $1\, M_\odot$ star). This value of $\alpha$ is effectively an upper limit, since it assumes efficient extinction of FUV photons throughout the embedded phase. With this gas expulsion timescale we are able to produce a full dynamical model that fits kinematic and morphological data as well as disc fractions. We suggest Cygnus OB2 was originally composed of distinct massive clumps or filaments, each with a stellar mass $\sim 10^4 \, M_\odot$. Finally we predict that in regions of efficient FUV induced mass loss, disc mass $M_\mathrm{disc}$ as a function of stellar host mass $m_\mathrm{star}$ follows a power law with $M_\mathrm{disc} \propto m_\mathrm{star}^\beta$, where $\beta \gtrsim 2.7$ (depending on disc initial conditions and FUV exposure). This is steeper than observed correlations in regions of moderate FUV flux ($1 < \beta <1.9$), and offers a promising diagnostic to establish the influence of external photoevaporation in a given region.},

  abstract = {Out of the 3000 exoplanets detected so far, only 14 planets are members of open clusters: one of them is the exoplanet system around Pr 0211 in the cluster M44. The system consists of at least 2 planets, and the outer planet moves on a highly eccentric orbit at 5.5 AU. One hypothesis is that a close fly-by of a neighbouring star was responsible for the eccentric orbit. We test this hypothesis. First we determined the type of fly-by that would lead to the observed parameters, and then we used this result to determine the history of such fly-bys in simulations of the early dynamics in an M44-like environment. We find that although very close fly-bys are required to obtain the observed properties of Pr 0211c, such fly-bys are relatively common as a result of the high stellar density and longevity of the cluster. Such close fly-bys are most frequent during the first 1-2 Myr after cluster formation, corresponding to a cluster age ≤3 Myr. During the first 2 to 3 Myr, about 6.5% of stars experience a fly-by that would lead to such a small system-size as observed for Pr 0211 or even smaller. It is unclear whether planets generally form on such short timescales. However, after this time, the close fly-by rate is still 0.2-0.5 Myr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which means that 12-20% of stars would experience such close fly-bys over this time span when we extrapolate the situation to the age of M44. Our simulations show that the fly-by scenario is a realistic option for the formation of eccentricity orbits of the planets in M44 (Wang et al. 2015). The occurrence of such events is relatively high, leading to the expectation that similar systems are likely common in open clusters in general.},

  abstract = {We explore the influence of hot background temperatures in stellar clusters on the formation and evolution of photoevaporating disks. The disk forms from the gravitational collapse of a pre-stellar core. For a core with a relatively high temperature (&gt;40 K), the angular momentum of the core is expected to be low. In the core-collapse stage, most of core mass directly falls onto the central star or the disk near the star. External photoevaporation is ineffective in this environment. The viscosity in the disk dominates its evolution, which leads to a high efficiency of the mass and angular momentum transports. The disk properties are determined by the core properties. In the vicinity of massive stars with strong external FUV fields, the disk can still survive when the background temperature is high (̃100 K). We suggest that the diversity of the molecular cloud core properties may lead to the diverse properties of the disk photoevaporation in clusters. We also consistently interpret the findings in NGC 1333 that low-mass disks (0.002-0.004 M <SUB>☉</SUB>) can exist in such young clusters (1-2 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> yr) with mild external photoevaporation.},

For this reason, OCs are considered an importantlaboratory to study the relation between the physical properties of the planets and those of their host stars, and the evolution of planetary systems. However, only a handful of planets have been discovered around OC main-sequence stars so far, all of them in single-planet systems. For this reason we started an observational campaign within the GAPS collaboration to search for and characterize planets in OCs<i>Aims. <i/>We monitored the Praesepe member Pr 0211 to improve our knowledge of the eccentricity of the hot Jupiter (HJ) that is already known to orbit this star and search for additional intermediate-mass planets. An eccentric orbit for the HJ would support a planet-planet scattering process rather than a disk-driven migration after its formation.<i>Methods. <i/>From 2012 to 2015, we collected 70 radial velocity (RV) measurements with HARPS-N and 36 with TRES of Pr 0211. Simultaneous photometric observations were carried out with the robotic STELLA telescope to characterize the stellar activity. We discovered a long-term trend in the RV residuals that we show as being due to the presence of a second, massive, outer planet. Orbital parameters for the two planets are derived by simultaneously fitting RVs and photometric light curves, with the activity signal modelled as a series of sinusoids at the rotational period of the star and its harmonics.<i>Results. <i/>We confirm that Pr 0211b has a nearly circular orbit (<i>e<i/> = 0.02 ± 0.01), with an improvement of a factor two with respect to the previous determination of its eccentricity, and estimate that Pr 0211c has a mass <i>M<i/><sub>p<sub/> sin <i>i<i/> = 7.9 ± 0.2 <i>M<i/><sub>J<sub/>, a period <i>P<i/>> 3500 days and a very eccentric orbit (<i>e<i/>> 0.60).

  volume = {480},

  abstract = {During the evolution of protoplanetary disc, photoevaporations of both central and external stars play important roles. Considering the complicated radiation surroundings in the clusters, where the star formed, the protoplanetary discs survive in different lifetimes due to flyby events. In this paper, we mainly focus on the disc around a T Tauri star, which encounters with another main-sequence star with different temperatures in hyperbolic orbits with different pericentre distances, eccentricities, and inclinations. We find the criterion for gap opening due to photoevaporation of central star after the flyby event. A gap is opened in the late stage of gas disc, and induces that the gap only influence the planet formation and migration limitedly. If the flyby orbit has a moderate value of pericentre distance, which weakly depends on the eccentricity and inclination, the external photoevaporation lead to a maximum mass loss during the flyby event. Flyby stars in orbits with smaller eccentricities or larger inclinations induce larger mass loss. Adopting a simple multiple flyby models, we conclude that in open clusters, gas discs usually survive in typical lifetimes between 1 and 10 Myr, except there are many massive stars in dense open clusters. In globular clusters, discs disperse very quickly and hardly produce the gas giant planets. The fast-depleted discs are probably responsible for the null detection of giant planets in globular clusters.},

As a result, radiative or dynamical interactions with neighbouring stars disrupt (proto)planetary systems and limit their radii, leaving a lasting impact on their potential habitability. In the solar neighbourhood, we find that the vast majority of stars form in unbound associations, such that the interaction of (proto)planetary systems with neighbouring stars is limited to the densest sub-regions. However, the fraction of star formation occurring in compact clusters was considerably higher in the past, peaking at ~50% in the young Milky Way at redshift z~2. These results demonstrate that the large-scale star formation environment affects the demographics of planetary systems and the occupation of the habitable zone. We show that planet formation is governed by multi-scale physics, in which Mpc-scale events such as galaxy mergers affect the AU-scale properties of (proto)planetary systems.},

In addition to surface brightness asymmetries and a warped morphology beyond ~1farcs5 for one lobe of the disk, we find that there exists an asymmetry in the spectral features of the grains between the northeastern and southwestern lobes. The mostly neutral color of the disk lobes implies roughly 1 μm-sized grains are responsible for the scattering. We find that the asymmetries in color and morphology can plausibly be explained by HD 32297's motion into a dense interstellar medium cloud at a relative velocity of 15 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>.

  abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope optical coronagraphic polarization imaging observations of the dusty debris disk HD 61005. The scattered light intensity image and polarization structure reveal a highly inclined disk with a clear asymmetric, swept back component, suggestive of significant interaction with the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). The combination of our new data with the published 1.1 μm discovery image shows that the grains are blue scattering with no strong color gradient as a function of radius, implying predominantly submicron-sized grains. We investigate possible explanations that could account for the observed swept back, asymmetric morphology. Previous work has suggested that HD 61005 may be interacting with a cold, unusually dense interstellar cloud. However, limits on the intervening interstellar gas column density from an optical spectrum of HD 61005 in the Na I D lines render this possibility unlikely. Instead, HD 61005 may be embedded in a more typical warm, low-density cloud that introduces secular perturbations to dust grain orbits. This mechanism can significantly distort the ensemble disk structure within a typical cloud crossing time. For a counterintuitive relative flow direction—parallel to the disk midplane—we find that the structures generated by these distortions can very roughly approximate the HD 61005 morphology. Future observational studies constraining the direction of the relative ISM flow will thus provide an important constraint for future modeling. Independent of the interpretation for HD 61005, we expect that interstellar gas drag likely plays a role in producing asymmetries observed in other debris disk systems, such as HD 15115 and δ Velorum.},

  abstract = {In view of both the size of its gap and the previously reported asymmetries and near-infrared spiral arms, the transition disk of the Herbig Fe star HD 142527 constitutes a remarkable case study. This paper focuses on the morphology of the outer disk through ALMA observations of <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 2-1, <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 3-2, and <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 2-1. Both <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 2-1 and <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 3-2 show spiral features of different sizes. The innermost spiral arm (S1) is a radio counterpart of the first near-infrared spiral observed by Fukagawa, but it is shifted radially outward. However, the most conspicuous CO spiral arm (S2) lies at the outskirts of the disk and has not been detected before. It corresponds to a cold density structure, with both brightness and excitation temperatures of order 13±2 K and conspicuous in the <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 2-1 peak-intensity map, but faint in <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 3-2. There is also a faint counterarm (S3), at a point-symmetric location of S2 with respect to the star. These three spirals are modeled separately with two different formulae that approximate the loci of density maxima in acoustic waves due to embedded planets. S1 could be fit relatively well with these formulae, compared to S2 and S3. Alternative scenarios such as gravitational instability or external tidal interaction are discussed. The impact of channelization on spectrally and spatially resolved peak intensity maps is also briefly addressed.},

Although previous sub-mm imagery suggested the existence of a dust-depleted cavity at r &lt;= 46 AU, our observations reveal the presence of scattered light components as close as 0farcs2 (~ 28 AU) from the star. Moreover, we have discovered two small-scale spiral structures lying within 0farcs5 (~ 70 AU). We present models for the spiral structures using the spiral density wave theory, and derive a disk aspect ratio of h ~ 0.1, which is consistent with previous sub-mm observations. This model can potentially give estimates of the temperature and rotation profiles of the disk based on dynamical processes, independently from sub-mm observations. It also predicts the evolution of the spiral structures, which can be observable on timescales of 10-20 years, providing conclusive tests of the model. While we cannot uniquely identify the origin of these spirals, planets embedded in the disk may be capable of exciting the observed morphology. Assuming that this is the case, we can make predictions on the locations and, possibly, the masses of the unseen planets. Such planets may be detected by future multi-wavelength observations.

  abstract = {We present sub-arcsecond images of AB Auriga obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer in the isotopologues of CO, and in continuum at 3 and 1.3 mm. These observations allow us to trace the structure of the circumstellar material of <ASTROBJ>AB Aur</ASTROBJ> in regions where optical and IR imaging is impossible because of the emission from the star. These images reveal that the environment of AB Aur is widely different from the proto-planetary disks that surround T Tauri stars like DM Tau and LkCa15 or HAeBe stars like MWC 480 in several aspects. Instead of being centrally peaked, the continuum emission is dominated by a bright, asymmetric (spiral-like) feature at about 140 AU from the central star. Little emission is associated with the star itself. The molecular emission shows that AB Aur is surrounded by a very extended flattened structure ("disk"), which is rotating around the star. Bright molecular emission is also found towards the continuum "spiral". The large-scale molecular structure suggests the AB Aur disk is inclined between 23 and 43 degrees, but the strong asymmetry of the continuum and molecular emission prevents an accurate determination of the inclination of the inner parts. Analysis of the emission in terms of a Keplerian disk provides a reasonable fit to the data, but fails to give a consistent picture because the inclinations determined from <SUP>12</SUP>CO J~= 2~→ 1, <SUP>13</SUP>CO J~= 2~→ 1, <SUP>13</SUP>CO J~= 1~→ 0 and C<SUP>18</SUP>O J~= 1~→ 0 do not agree. The mass predicted for the central star in such Keplerian models is in the range 0.9 to 1.2 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, much smaller than the expected 2.2 M<SUB>☉</SUB> from the spectral type of AB Aur. Better and more consistent fits to the <SUP>13</SUP>CO J~= 2~→ 1, <SUP>13</SUP>CO J~= 1~→ 0 data are obtained by relaxing the Keplerian hypothesis. We find significant non-Keplerian motion, with a best fit exponent for the rotation velocity law of 0.41 ± 0.01, but no evidence for radial motion. The disk has an inner hole about 70 AU in radius. The disk is warm and shows no evidence of depletion of CO. The dust properties suggest that the dust is less evolved than in typical T Tauri disks. Both the spiral-like feature and the departure from purely Keplerian motion indicates the AB Aur disk is not in quasi-equilibrium. Disk self-gravity is insufficient to create the perturbation. This behavior may be related either to an early phase of star formation in which the Keplerian regime is not yet fully established and/or to a disturbance of yet unknown origin. An alternate, but unproven, possibility is that of a low mass companion located about 40 AU from AB Aur.},

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 (335 GHz or 0.89 mm) continuum observations of the transition disk HD 135344B at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 0.″16, using superuniform weighting. The data show that the asymmetric millimeter-dust ring seen in previous work actually consists of an inner ring and an outer asymmetric structure. The outer feature is cospatial with the end of one of the spiral arms seen in scattered light, but the feature itself is not consistent with a spiral arm due to its coradiance. We propose a new possible scenario to explain the observed structures at both wavelengths. Hydrodynamical simulations show that a massive planet can generate a primary vortex (which dissipates at longer timescales, becoming an axisymmetric ring) and trigger the formation of a second generation vortex further out. Within this scenario, the two spiral arms observed at scattered light originate from a planet at ̃30 au and from the secondary vortex at ̃75 au rather than a planet further out as previously reported.},

The 0.44-millimeter-wavelength continuum map shows high-contrast crescent-shaped emission on one side of the star, originating from millimeter-sized grains, whereas both the mid-infrared image (micrometer-sized dust) and the gas traced by the carbon monoxide 6-5 rotational line suggest rings centered on the star.

The observations resolve the inner gap in the dust emission and reveal an asymmetric dust distribution in the outer disk. By comparing the observations with theoretical disk models, we calculate that 90% of the dust emission arises from an azimuthally symmetric ring that contains about 5 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> M <SUB>☉</SUB> of dust. A low surface-brightness tail that extends to the northwest out to a radius of about 300 AU contains the remaining 10% of the observed continuum emission. The ring is modeled with a rather flat surface density profile between 40 and 120 AU, while the inner cavity is consistent with either a sharp drop of the 1.3 mm dust optical depth at about 42 AU or a smooth inward decrease between 3 and 85 AU. We show that early science Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations will be able to disentangle these two scenarios. Within 40 AU, the observations constrain the amount of dust between 10<SUP>-6</SUP> and 7 Earth masses, where the minimum and maximum limits are set by the near-infrared spectral energy distribution modeling and by the millimeter-wave observations of the dust emission, respectively. In addition, we confirm the discrepancy in the outer disk radius inferred from the dust and gas, which corresponds to 150 AU and 900 AU, respectively. We cannot reconcile this difference by adopting an exponentially tapered surface density profile as suggested for other systems, but we instead suggest that the gas surface density in the outer disk decreases less steeply than that predicted by model fits to the dust continuum emission. The lack of continuum emission at radii larger than 120 AU suggests a drop of at least a factor of five in the dust-to-gas ratio or in the dust opacity. We show that a sharp dust opacity drop of this magnitude is consistent with a radial variation of the grain size distribution as predicted by existing grain growth models.},

The inner disk, which has not been studied previously at sufficient resolution and imaging dynamic range, seems to contain very little gas inside a radius of least 130 AU from the star. Using adaptive optics coronagraphy and polarimetry, we have imaged the dust in an annulus between 43 and 302 AU from the star, a region never seen before. An azimuthal gap in an annulus of dust at a radius of 102 AU, along with a clearing at closer radii inside this annulus, suggests the formation of at least one small body at an orbital distance of ~100 AU. This structure seems consistent with crude models of mean motion resonances or accumulation of material at two of the Lagrange points relative to the putative object and the star. We also report a low significance detection of a point source in this outer annulus of dust. This source may be an overdensity in the disk due to dust accreting onto an unseen companion. An alternate interpretation suggests that the object's mass is between 5 and 37 times the mass of Jupiter. The results have implications for circumstellar disk dynamics and planet formation.},

  abstract = {Misalignments between the orbital planes of planets and the equatorial planes of their host stars have been observed in our solar system, in transiting exoplanets, and for the orbital planes of debris discs. We present a mechanism that causes such a spin-orbit misalignment for a protoplanetary disc due to its movement through an ambient medium. Our physical explanation of the mechanism is based on the theoretical solutions to the Stark problem. We test this idea by performing self-consistent hydrodynamical simulations and simplified gravitational N-body simulations. The N-body model reduces the mechanism to the relevant physical processes. The hydrodynamical simulations show the mechanism in its full extent, including gas-dynamical and viscous processes in the disc which are not included in the theoretical framework. We find that a protoplanetary disc embedded in a flow changes its orientation as its angular momentum vector tends to align parallel to the relative velocity vector. Due to the force exerted by the flow, orbits in the disc become eccentric, which produces a net torque and consequentially changes the orbital inclination. The tilting of the disc causes it to contract. Apart from becoming lopsided, the gaseous disc also forms a spiral arm even if the inclination does not change substantially. The process is most effective at high velocities and observational signatures are therefore mostly expected in massive star-forming regions and around winds or supernova ejecta. Our N-body model indicates that the interaction with supernova ejecta is a viable explanation for the observed spin-orbit misalignment in our solar system.},

  abstract = {Context. NGC 6611 and its parental cloud, the Eagle Nebula (M 16), are well-studied star-forming regions, thanks to their large content of both OB stars and stars with disks and the observed ongoing star formation. In our previous studies of the Eagle Nebula, we identified 834 disk-bearing stars associated with the cloud, after detecting their excesses in NIR bands from J band to 8.0 μ m. <BR /> Aims: In this paper, we study in detail the nature of a subsample of disk-bearing stars that show peculiar characteristics. They appear older than the other members in the V vs. V-I diagram, and/or they have one or more IRAC colors at pure photospheric values, despite showing NIR excesses, when optical and infrared colors are compared. <BR /> Methods: We confirm the membership of these stars to M 16 by a spectroscopic analysis. The physical properties of these stars with disks are studied by comparing their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with the SEDs predicted by models of T Tauri stars with disks and envelopes. <BR /> Results: We show that the age of these stars estimated from the V vs. V-I diagram is unreliable since their V-I colors are altered by the light scattered by the disk into the line of sight. Only in a few cases their SEDs are compatible with models with excesses in V band caused by optical veiling. Candidate members with disks and photospheric IRAC colors are selected by the used NIR disk diagnostic, which is sensitive to moderate excesses, such as those produced by disks with low masses. In 1/3 of these cases, scattering of stellar flux by the disks can also be invoked. <BR /> Conclusions: The photospheric light scattered by the disk grains into the line of sight can affect the derivation of physical parameters of Class II stars from photometric optical and NIR data. Besides, the disks diagnostic we defined are useful for selecting stars with disks, even those with moderate excesses or whose optical colors are altered by veiling or photospheric scattered light.

Our survey gives a detailed look at disk survivability within the hot-star-dominated environment in this cavity. Using mid-infrared two-color diagrams ([3.6]-[4.5] vs. [5.8]-[8.0]), we identified 337 class II and 25 class I objects out of 1084 objects detected in all four of these bands with photometric uncertainty better than 10%. Including the 24 μm data, we found 213 class II and 20 class I sources out of 279 stars also detected at this latter band. The center of the class II density contours is in very good agreement with the center of the cluster detected in the 2MASS images. We studied the distribution of the class II sources relative to the O stars and found that the effect of high-mass stars on the circumstellar disks is significant only in their immediate vicinity.},

These data are combined with published MIPS photometry for 15 additional association members to assess the frequency of circumstellar disks around 5 Myr old stars with spectral types between B0 and M5. Twelve stars have a detectable 70 μm excess, each of which also has a detectable 24 μm excess. A total of 54 stars are identified with a 24 μm excess more than 32% above the stellar photosphere. The MIPS observations reveal 19 excess sources—8 A/F/G stars and 11 K/M stars—that were not previously identified with an 8 μm or 16 μm excess. The lack of short-wavelength emission and the weak 24 μm excess suggests that these sources are debris systems or the remnants of optically thick primordial disks with inner holes. Despite the wide range of luminosities of the stars hosting apparent debris systems, the excess characteristics are consistent with all stars having dust at similar orbital radii after factoring in variations in the radiation blowout particle size with spectral type. The results for Upper Sco are compared to similar photometric surveys from the literature to re-evaluate the evolution of debris emission. After considering the completeness limits of published surveys and the effects of stellar evolution on the debris luminosity, we find that the magnitude of the 24 μm excess around F-type stars increases between ages of 5 and 17 Myr as found by previous studies, but at lsim2.6σ confidence. For B7-A9 and G0-K5 stars, any variations in the observed 24 μm excess emission over this age range are significant at less than 2σ confidence.},

Here, we use millimetric and centimetric radio data to constrain the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) luminosity impinging on 14 disks around young (\textasciitilde{}2-10 Myr) sun-like stars. For each object we identify the long-wavelength emission in excess to the dust thermal emission, attribute that to free-free disk emission, and thereby compute an upper limit to the EUV reaching the disk. We find upper limits lower than 10\textsuperscript{42} photons s\textsuperscript{-1} for all sources without jets and lower than 5 × 10\textsuperscript{40} photons s\textsuperscript{-1} for the three older sources in our sample. These latter values are low for EUV-driven photoevaporation alone to clear out protoplanetary material in the timescale inferred by observations. In addition, our EUV upper limits are too low to reproduce the [Ne II] 12.81 μm luminosities from three disks with slow [Ne II]-detected winds. This indicates that the [Ne II] line in these sources primarily traces a mostly neutral wind where Ne is ionized by 1 keV X-ray photons, implying higher photoevaporative mass loss rates than those predicted by EUV-driven models alone. In summary, our results suggest that high-energy stellar photons other than EUV may dominate the dispersal of protoplanetary disks around sun-like stars.},

  abstract = {Computing the flow from externally FUV irradiated protoplanetary discs requires solving complicated and expensive photodissociation physics iteratively in conjunction with hydrodynamics. Previous studies have therefore been limited to 1D models of this process. In this paper we compare 2D-axisymmetric models of externally photoevaporating discs with their 1D analogues, finding that mass loss rates are consistent to within a factor four. The mass loss rates in 2D are higher, in part because half of the mass loss comes from the disc surface (which 1D models neglect). 1D mass loss rates used as the basis for disc viscous evolutionary calculations are hence expected to be conservative. We study the anatomy of externally driven winds including the streamline morphology, kinematic, thermal and chemical structure. A key difference between the 1D and 2D models is in the chemical abundances. For instance in the 2D models CO can be dissociated at smaller radial distances from the disc outer edge than in 1D calculations because gas is photodissociated by radiation along trajectories that are assumed infinitely optically thick in 1D models. Multidimensional models will hence be critical for predicting observable signatures of environmentally photoevaporating protoplanetary discs.},

  abstract = {We present the first radiation-hydrodynamic model of a protoplanetary disc irradiated with an X-ray extreme ultraviolet (X-EUV) spectrum. In a model where the total ionizing luminosity is divided equally between X-ray and EUV luminosity, we find a photoevaporation rate of 1.4 × 10\textsuperscript{-8}M\textsubscript{solar}yr\textsuperscript{-1}, which is two orders of magnitude greater than the case of EUV photoevaporation alone. Thus, it is clear that the X-rays are the dominant driving mechanism for photoevaporation. This can be understood inasmuch as X-rays are capable of penetrating much larger columns (\textasciitilde{}10\textsuperscript{22}cm\textsuperscript{-2}) and can thus effect heating in denser regions and at larger radius than the EUV. The radial extent of the launching region of the X-ray-heated wind is 1-70au compared with the pure EUV case where the launch region is concentrated around a few au. When we couple our wind mass-loss rates with models for the disc's viscous evolution, we find that, as in the pure EUV case, there is a photoevaporative switch, such that an inner hole develops at \textasciitilde{}1au at the point when the accretion rate in the disc drops below the wind mass-loss rate. At this point, the remaining disc material is quickly removed in the final 15-20 per cent of the disc's lifetime. This is consistent with the 10\textsuperscript{5}yr transitional time-scale estimated from observations of T Tauri stars. We however note several key differences to previous EUV-driven photoevaporation models. The two orders of magnitude higher photoevaporation rate is now consistent with the average accretion rate observed in young stars and will cut the disc off in its prime. Moreover, the extended mass-loss profile subjects the disc to a significant period (\textasciitilde{}20 per cent of the disc's lifetime) of `photoevaporation-starved accretion'. We also caution that although our mass-loss rates are high compared to some accretion rates observed in young stars, our model has a rather large X-ray luminosity of 2 × 10\textsuperscript{30}ergs\textsuperscript{-1} further modelling is required in order to investigate the evolutionary implications of the large observed spread of X-ray luminosities in T Tauri stars.},

These ALMA observations can resolve binary separations as small as 25─30 au and have an average 3σ detection level of 0.35 mJy, equivalent to a disk mass of 4 × 10\textsuperscript{−5} M \textsubscript{☉} for an M3 star. Our sample was constructed from stars that have an infrared excess and/or signs of accretion and have been classified as Class II. For the binary and higher-order multiple systems observed, we detect λ = 1.3 mm continuum emission from one or more stars in all of our target systems. Combined with previous surveys of Taurus, our 21 new detections increase the fraction of millimeter-detected disks to over 75\% in all categories of stars (singles, primaries, and companions) earlier than spectral type M6 in the Class II sample. Given the wealth of other information available for these stars, this has allowed us to study the impact of multiplicity with a much larger sample. While millimeter flux and disk mass are related to stellar mass as seen in previous studies, we find that both primary and secondary stars in binary systems with separations of 30─4200 au have lower values of millimeter flux as a function of stellar mass than single stars. We also find that for these systems, the circumstellar disk around the primary star does not dominate the total disk mass in the system and contains on average 62\% of the total mass.},

Here, the relative alignment between stars and their protoplanetary discs is assessed for the first time for a sample of 20 pre-main-sequence stars. Recently published rotation periods derived from high-quality, long-duration, high-cadence K2 light curves for members of the ρ Ophiuchus and Upper Scorpius star-forming regions are matched with high angular resolution observations of spatially resolved discs and projected rotational velocities to determine stellar rotation axis inclination angles which are then compared to the disc inclinations. Ten of the 15 systems for which the stellar inclination could be estimated are consistent with star-disc alignment while five systems indicate potential misalignments between the star and its disc. The potential for chance misalignment of aligned systems due to projection effects and characteristic measurement uncertainties is also investigated. While the observed frequency of apparent star-disc misalignments could be reproduced by a simulated test population in which 100\{\{ per cent\}\} of systems are truly aligned, the distribution of the scale of inferred misalignment angles could not.},

  abstract = {Habitable zones are regions around stars where large bodies of liquid water can be sustained on a planet or satellite. As many stars form in binary systems with non-zero eccentricity, the habitable zones around the component stars of the binary can overlap and be enlarged when the two stars are at periastron (and less often when the stars are at apastron). We perform N-body simulations of the evolution of dense star-forming regions and show that binary systems where the component stars originally have distinct habitable zones can undergo interactions that push the stars closer together, causing the habitable zones to merge and become enlarged. Occasionally, overlapping habitable zones can occur if the component stars move further apart, but the binary becomes more eccentric. Enlargement of habitable zones happens to 1-2 binaries from an average initial total of 352 in each simulated star-forming region, and demonstrates that dense star-forming regions are not always hostile environments for planet formation and evolution.},

  abstract = {We have conducted a survey of 17 wide ({$>$}100 AU) young binary systems in Taurus with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) at two wavelengths. The observations were designed to measure the masses of circumstellar disks in these systems as an aid to understanding the role of multiplicity in star and planet formation. The ALMA observations had sufﬁcient resolution to localize emission within the binary system. Disk emission was detected around all primaries and 10 secondaries, with disk masses as low as 10−4 M . We compare the properties of our sample to the population of known disks in Taurus and ﬁnd that the disks from this binary sample match the scaling between stellar mass and millimeter ﬂux of Fmm ∝ M∗1.5–2.0 to within the scatter found in previous studies. We also compare the properties of the primaries to those of the secondaries and ﬁnd that the secondary/primary stellar and disk mass ratios are not correlated; in three systems, the circumsecondary disk is more massive than the circumprimary disk, counter to some theoretical predictions.},

  abstract = {We present a high angular resolution millimeter-wave dust continuum imaging survey of circumstellar material associated with the individual components of 23 multiple star systems in the Taurus-Auriga young cluster. Combined with previous measurements in the literature, these new data permit a comprehensive look at how the millimeter luminosity (a rough tracer of disk mass) relates to the separation and mass of a stellar companion. Approximately one-third (28\%-37\%) of the individual stars in multiple systems have detectable millimeter emission, an incidence rate half that for single stars (\textasciitilde{}62\%) which does not depend on the number of companions. There is a strong, positive correlation between the luminosity and projected separation (a\textsubscript{p} ) of a stellar pair. Wide pairs (a\textsubscript{p} \&gt; 300 AU) have a similar luminosity distribution as single stars, medium pairs (a\textsubscript{p} ≈ 30-300 AU) are a factor of five fainter, and close pairs (a\textsubscript{p} \&lt; 30 AU) are \textasciitilde{}5× fainter yet (aside from a small, but notable population of bright circumbinary disks). In most cases, the emission is dominated by a disk around the primary (or a wide tertiary in hierarchical triples), but there is no clear relationship between luminosity and stellar mass ratio. A direct comparison of resolved disk sizes with predictions from tidal truncation models yields mixed results; some disks are much larger than expected given the projected distances of their companions. We suggest that the presence of a stellar companion impacts disk properties at a level comparable to the internal evolution mechanisms that operate in an isolated system, with both the multiple star formation process itself and star-disk tidal interactions likely playing important roles in the evolution of circumstellar material. From the perspective of the mass content of the disk reservoir, we expect that (giant) planet formation is inhibited around the components of close pairs or secondaries, but should be as likely as for single stars around the primaries (or wide tertiaries in hierarchical triples) in more widely separated multiple star systems.},

  title = {The Evolution of Photoevaporating Viscous Discs in Binaries},
  volume = {473},
  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stx2769},
  abstract = {A large fraction of stars are in binary systems, yet the evolution of protoplanetary discs in binaries has been little explored from the theoretical side. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the discs surrounding the primary and secondary components of binary systems on the assumption that this is driven by photoevaporation induced by X-rays from the respective star. We show how for close enough separations (20-30 au for average X-ray luminosities) the tidal torque of the companion changes the qualitative behaviour of disc dispersal from inside out to outside in. Fewer transition discs created by photoevaporation are thus expected in binaries. We also demonstrate that in close binaries the reduction in viscous time leads to accelerated disc clearing around both components, consistent with unresolved observations. When looking at the differential disc evolution around the two components, in close binaries discs around the secondary clear first due to the shorter viscous time-scale associated with the smaller outer radius. In wide binaries instead the difference in photoevaporation rate makes the secondaries longer lived, though this is somewhat dependent on the assumed scaling of viscosity with stellar mass. We find that our models are broadly compatible with the growing sample of resolved observations of discs in binaries. We also predict that binaries have higher accretion rates than single stars for the same disc mass. Thus, binaries probably contribute to the observed scatter in the relationship between disc mass and accretion rate in young stars.},

  abstract = {Aims: This study aims to determine the impact of stellar binary companions on the lifetime and evolution of circumstellar disks in the Chamaeleon I (Cha I) star-forming region by measuring the frequency and strength of accretion and circumstellar dust signatures around the individual components of T Tauri binary stars. \\
 Methods: We used high-angular resolution adaptive optics JHK\textsubscript{s}L' -band photometry and 1.5-2.5 μm spectroscopy of 19 visual binary and 7 triple stars in Cha I - including one newly discovered tertiary component - with separations between \textasciitilde{}25 and \textasciitilde{}1000 AU. The data allowed us to infer stellar component masses and ages and, from the detection of near-infrared excess emission and the strength of Brackett-γ emission, the presence of ongoing accretion and hot circumstellar dust of the individual stellar components of each binary. \\
 Results: Of all the stellar components in close binaries with separations of 25-100 AU, 10\textsuperscript{+15}\textsubscript{-5}\% show signs of accretion. This is less than half of the accretor fraction found in wider binaries, which itself appears significantly reduced (\textasciitilde{}44\%) compared with previous measurements of single stars in Cha I. Hot dust was found around 50\textsuperscript{+30}\textsubscript{-15}\% of the target components, a value that is indistinguishable from that of Cha I single stars. Only the closest binaries (\&lt;25 AU) were inferred to have a significantly reduced fraction (≲25\%) of components that harbor hot dust. Accretors were exclusively found in binary systems with unequal component masses M\textsubscript{secondary}/M\textsubscript{primary} \&lt; 0.8, implying that the detected accelerated disk dispersal is a function of mass-ratio. This agrees with the finding that only one accreting secondary star was found, which is also the weakest accretor in the sample. \\
 Conclusions: The results imply that disk dispersal is more accelerated the stronger the dynamical disk truncation, i.e., the smaller the inferred radius of the disk. Nonetheless, the overall measured mass accretion rates appear to be independent of the cluster environment or the existence of stellar companions at any separation ≳25 AU, because they agree well with observations from our previous binary study in the Orion Nebula cluster and with studies of single stars in these and other star-forming regions.
