\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Circumstellar disks are formed shortly after star formation. During their early years, they are immersed in the environment of star formation; that is, surrounded by left over gas and prone to dynamical interactions with other, nearby stars. Young star forming regions, less than 2 Myr old, have been observed to have protoplanetary disks in more than 80\% of the cases \citep{fedele2010}. Since stars are not born in isolation, and remaining gas can stay for up to X Myr \note{add ref}, the disks stay embedded in this environment during their first million years of evolution. This environment can be hostile for the disks in a myriad of ways. In terms of surrounding gas, the disks can be shrunk by ram pressure stripping and face-on accretion \citep{wijnen2016, wijnen2017}. Regarding the stellar dense environment, disks can be subject to dynamical truncations \citep{portegieszwart2016, vincke2015, vincke2016} or be affected indirectly by processes generated though the evolution of stars, such as stellar winds \note{add ref}, supernovae explosions \citep{close2017}, and photoevaporation due to bright OB stars in the vicinity \citep[e.g.][]{haworth2017, guarcello2016}. Since planets seem to form very quickly in the disks \note{citation??? get someting from the betigyn, manara paper on disk masses being too low for planets}, understanding the processes that affect the evolution of the disks is in direct relation with understanding planet formation.

It is interesting to look into the evolution of circumstellar disks inside star clusters. Our very own Sun was born within a star cluster, so understanding how the cluster environment affects the evolution of the disks can help us understand the origins of our own Solar System. Previous work has been done to study the effects of viscous growth (me, Rossoti2014) and dynamical truncations on circumstellar disks inside star clusters (spz, pfalzner). This has been done both semi-analytically and numerically. 

The environment in which the disks is surrounded is though. FUV radiation of up to X G0 has been measured in star forming regions \citep{haworth2017} \note{see: references of haworth2017, references of winter2018}. Protoplanetary disks have been observed to be photoevaporating. i.e. we know this happens. Work has also been done in studying both the internal and external photoevaporation of circumstellar disks. Inside star clusters, it is likely that the disks will be affected by radiation from bright stars. Work by ... and ... shows that disks are especially sensitive to FUV radiation from OB stars.

In \citet{concha-ramirez2018}, we carried out simulations where we investigated the effect of viscous growth and dynamical truncations on protoplanetary disks inside stars clusters. Results showed that the disks obtained in the simulations were overestimated, compared to disks observed in star forming regions. In the present work, we look to expand those results by adding external photoevaporation to the simulations. In this way we aim to provide a more realistic \note{(?)} environment in our simulations. 

This problem is very expensive to run numerically... so as in our previous paper, we use a semi-analytical model to paramterize the viscous growth of the disks. We use the FRIED grid by \citet{haworth2018} to calculate the external photevaporative mass loss on each disk. 


In this work we present a semi analytical modelling of protoplanetary disks subject to viscous growth, dynamical truncations, and external photevaporation. We expand on the work by \citet{concha-ramirez2018}, where viscous growth and truncations were modelled semi analytically. We use the developments of X and Y to parametrize external photevaporation as a mass loss rate on the disk.

Our previous work showed that considering only viscous growth and dynamical truncations yields disks that are too large to be compared with current observations of protoplanetary disks. Dynamical truncations by themselves are not important enough to account for the sizes of the observed disks. There must be some other mechanisms that generates the compact disks we observe in star clusters and young star forming regions.


\section{Model}
\label{sec:model}

The viscous growth and the dynamical truncations were modeled in the same way as in FCR2018. In sections 1 and 2 we present a summary of the implementations. In section 3 we present the new implementations for photevaporation developed for the present work.

\subsection{Viscous growth of disks}

We base our description of the disks on the similarity solutions of Lynden-Bell and Pringle 1974, and the implementation of Hartmann1998. We characterize our disks by three values: their characteristic radius, their mass, and their accretion rate onto their host star.

We use values of gamma=1 and alpha=1E-4 as argued in FCR2018. This gives us realistic viscous timescales for the disks.

In this occasion we consider the characteristic radius as the radius inside which 95\% of the disk's mass resides. This, to make a closer comparison with observations (cite same reference than in my previous paper).

\subsection{Dynamical truncations}
Dynamical truncations are the same as in the previous paper. Defined by SPZ. We also use the mass from X.

\subsection{Photoevaporation}
External photoevaporation of protoplanetary disks is dominated by FUV radiation. We follow \citet{adams2004} in defining the FUV range as being between 


We modeled only the external photoevaporation of the disk. We consider internal photoevaporation to be negligible for our analyses.

We model external photoevaporation as a mass loss that affects the stellar disks. This mass loss was calculated using the FRIED grid. The FRIED grid is a grid which calculates FUV photoevaporative mass losses for a big parameter space of disks. 

\subsubsection{Getting the FUV luminosity of the stars}
We need to calculate the FUV luminosity of each of the massive stars. For this, we use the UVBLUE spectral library. We choose all our stars to have solar metallicity. We take the ZAMS temperature of each massive star.

We calculate the ZAMS luminosity of the stars. From this we choose a spectrum, and we fit it. This allows us to get a stellar mass vs FUV luminosity relationship, which is what we use to calculate the FUV luminosity of each star all through our simulation. The fit can be seen in Figure X. The values obtained for the fit can be seen in Table Y.

External photoevaporation of the disks is a function not only of the disk properties, but also of the radiation field in which the disk is immersed. tion not only of the disk properties, but also of the radiation field in which the disk is immersed. 

\subsection{Evolution of the disks}
For each simulation we did the following:

-Start a Plummer sphere with N number of stars and virial size N

-Select all the stars under 1.9 MSun (because of the FRIED grid parameter space). To all these stars we gave circumstellar disks.

-For all the stars > 1.9 MSun (a.k.a. massive stars) we implemented stellar evolution.

-We used the UVBLUE spectral library to calculate the FUV luminosity of each of these massive stars.

-On each timestep we calculate the positions of the stars, and the radiation that each small stars gets from all the massive stars, in the distance

-This gives us the total photoevaporative mass loss rate for each small star

-We update the size of the circumstellar disk according to the viscous growth and to the photoevaporative mass loss rate

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Initial conditions}
We run X simulations with N stars each located in Plummer (King?) spheres of Z size. We run M simulations lasting for 10 million years each. 

We then plot the cumulative distributions of the protoplanetary disks. To calculate the size of the protoplanetary disks we take the mass inside a characteristic radius. We set this radius to 95\% to make it similar to observations (check reference on my previous paper).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Caveats}
-We ignore the subsonic and supersonic photoevaporation regimes 

-We ignore dust growth and ignore different components for dust and gas disks 

-We ignore binaries (cite cool paper on circumbinary stuff)

-We ignore gas in the star forming regions

-We ignore actual stellar evolution!!!

-We could maybe actually evolve the disks instead of parametrizing them

\subsection{Comparison with observations}
